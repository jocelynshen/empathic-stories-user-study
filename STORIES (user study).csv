0,Facebook-MIT Confession,"You deserve someone who loves you just as much as you love them. I’ve been feeling the same way after my last girlfriend, who never really reciprocated, but part of what’s been getting me through this loneliness and longing is the knowledge that there are people out there who are interested in making a real emotional connection, and as you put it perfectly, falling “recklessly in love.” We’ve never met, and probably will never meet, but know that there are people out there who will love you for everything that you are. You just have to find them.","You deserve someone who loves you just as much as you love them.

1,Facebook-MIT Confession,"After having a pretty rough night where I constantly felt like I was on the verge of passing out, I went to bed and got around two hours of sleep. When I woke up, I felt completely sobered up, but the life circumstances that made me drink so much in the first place kept me awake for the next hour and a half, thinking and thinking. It's so hard to get away from your thoughts sometimes. Even though I really felt like I should sleep, I just couldn't, so I ended up getting out of bed, taking a cold shower, and heading on campus at six in the morning. Watching the sun rise on a new day as I made my way toward campus, I felt incredibly at peace despite the chaos that is my life right now. That feeling made me want to cry. I wish I could get up everyday early in the morning, feeling motivated to overcome anything that happens to me, but instead there are always days where I stay in bed until my roommate comes back from class, days where I sit in front of my computer with something to do but unable to bring myself to do it, days where I think giving up would be so much easier than fighting. I can't help but notice that most of my days are like that. But today is different. Today will be a good day, and I can't say the same for tomorrow or tomorrow's tomorrow or days, weeks, months, and years after that, but knowing that another day will come along where I wake up feeling like things are getting better makes me hope. It makes me hope that someday the balance will change, that I will be happy more often than I am sad, that my thoughts will let me go and let me live, that every difficult experience I have is moving me forward, not holding me back. I don’t know that any of this is relatable, and I can’t say that my situation is resolved after today, but I can’t help but marvel at the wonder that is hope. Having hope that things will be better and that life will go on, even when it feels impossible, has given me the strength to take this day in my hands and to make it what I want it to be. This hope will keep me walking on days when I feel like falling, and this hope tells me that no matter how hard it is today, no matter how much I hurt, no matter how unfathomable it is to continue, I will.","After having a pretty rough night where I constantly felt like I was on the verge of passing out, I went to bed and got around two hours of sleep.

3,Facebook-MIT Confession,"As a senior, I've been in reflection mode this semester and I've always hated how college has made even the coolest, smartest, and kindest people I know lose themselves to a lack of confidence and self-compassion. I think we take self-love for granted assuming it comes naturally when it takes so much work to overcome years of awful things aimed at making us like ourselves less. Please realize you are all amazing and strong and capable. I hope we continue to take care of ourselves and end up thriving after graduation.","As a senior, I've been in reflection mode this semester and I've always hated how college has made even the coolest, smartest, and kindest people I know lose themselves to a lack of confidence and self-compassion.

5,Facebook-MIT Confession,"During my orientation week, I heard a peer say they didn't know what DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) was and they didn't need to care about it. Fast forward five years, I spent a lot of my time on DEI initiatives, mainly because I was unhappy with the situations I and others were facing. And that confession that said they were skeptical of students being more interested in activism than research, just shows how easy it is for some students to look the other way. I spent years on DEI initiatives that are flaky at best because my department only half commits, and not even gonna mention admin shenanigans. I felt this was so important that my research progress struggled, that I had to drop projects and switch directions. I spent so much unrecognized time on DEI, and unfortunately it robbed time away from what I actually came here to do, but the working conditions here really merited the honest time I put into it. Some of us have no choice but to care because it impacts us, some of us have no choice but to be activists because otherwise we can't make it through the institute to do what we came here for. Some of us have no option but to care about our activism. My hope is the next generations don't have to go through this struggle.","During my orientation week, I heard a peer say they didn't know what DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) was and they didn't need to care about it.

6,Facebook-MIT Confession,"I ended my therapy sessions today. I don't feel bittersweet like I thought I would. I never really built up a really strong trust with my therapist, and while I've come a long way, I've never really felt comfortable telling them everything about my life. I ended therapy prematurely, but I got burned out. Not to mention it added a ton of financial stress to my life. I still stand by my decision to end therapy, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.","I ended my therapy sessions today. I don't feel bittersweet like I thought I would.

It took me almost the entire year to even understand the gravity of my situation (due to various things that have happened in my past). It took some realizing that therapy is only meant to point you in the right direction, but a lot of relief comes from taking some time for reflection and introspection. Try meditating a bit, see if that helps. In my case, this is partly true, since I was prescribed some medicinal interventions to help me get back on my feet (which is a totally valid treatment by the way; the stigma around it is bullshit). All I can say is that it gets with better with time. I know it's hard, but you need to put in the activation energy to start the healing process. I apologise if some of this comes off as blunt, but I empathize with you deeply, and I'm always free to talk.

7,Facebook-MIT Confession,"I switched academic advisors today. When I emailed my new advisor, I made a joke about my bad GPA, because my old advisor was upset with me for getting bad grades. (""Anon, maybe you're just not smart enough to be here."") My old advisor didn't want to have me because I made her look bad. My new advisor replied that he's honestly excited to get to know me better. He said he was going to work with me to figure out how to survive college. He didn't care that my GPA is bad. This unexpected support and acceptance made me sit down and sob for the first time in months. I didn't know why I was crying at first, but then I realized it was just the relief that someone was finally NOT judging me for my grades. Everyone who has seen my academic record just assumes things about me, because after all, how can you get D's and still deserve to be here? I realized that this is the first time in two years that I've felt like more than the sum of my GPA and academic achievements. That's how I know this is such a messed up place. Somehow, the faculty and staff have lost humanity amidst problem sets and exams and grades. I even forgot that I'm more than a sum of my academic achievements. It's easy to say to each other ""oh, you are more than your grades,"" but when your professors and advisor and faculty and mentors don't echo the same message, that's when things get bad. Thank God for this professor. To anyone else out there who feels like they're not good enough because their academic record isn't perfect, you are SO MUCH MORE than grades and problem sets and exams and school. You are a complex, beautiful, amazing human being and you deserve to be treated that way. Please don't forget it.","I switched academic advisors today.

10,Hippocorpus,"Recently I took a trip with my partner, Karl, to an amusement park about an hour east called Kentucky Kingdom. We don't have a ton of money to spend on vacation, so any little trip is a big deal for us. Also we totally suck at planning things, and hadn't done anything all summer, until we really buckled down and started making a cohesive plan. We splurged and got a hotel near the park for two nights, and invited a friend of ours from Tennessee to come stay with us too. His name was Nick, and we'd never met him. That is to say, we met him on Twitch. Karl and I started streaming a little over a year ago, and while I got bored of it fairly quickly, he kept at it and ended up starting a small group of streamers. Nick was one of the first members added to the group, all of us fans of the game Dropmix (a strange music/card game hybrid). In the months that followed we would all become closer watching each others stream at different times of the day, keeping each other company at work and so on. So when we invited him to stay with us, we felt like we knew him. I would describe myself as having a high degree of social anxiety. I had some hesitation about meeting someone in real life who only knew me from my online persona. But it ended up being awesome! Karl, Nick, and myself all share a love of roller coasters in addition to weird card games, and surprisingly none of us had ever been to Kentucky Kingdom before. The lines were short and they offered free soda to visitors from out of town (I won't say no!), the rides were awesome, and the people-watching was on point. The only drawback to the whole thing was that Nick and Karl both snore. But I'd had enough to drink each night that it wasn't much of an issue. I ended up feeling glad that we rallied and planned a trip, however quaint. It's something more people should try. Even just a few days away with friends made the stressful reality of day to day life a little more tolerable.","Recently I took a trip with my partner, Karl, to an amusement park about an hour east called Kentucky Kingdom.

So when we invited him to stay with us, we felt like we knew him. <br><br>I would describe myself as having a high degree of social anxiety. I had some hesitation about meeting someone in real life who only knew me from my online persona. But it ended up being awesome! Karl, Nick, and myself all share a love of roller coasters in addition to weird card games, and surprisingly none of us had ever been to Kentucky Kingdom before. <br><br>The lines were short and they offered free soda to visitors from out of town (I won't say no!), the rides were awesome, and the people-watching was on point. The only drawback to the whole thing was that Nick and Karl both snore. But I'd had enough to drink each night that it wasn't much of an issue. <br><br>I ended up feeling glad that we rallied and planned a trip, however quaint. It's something more people should try. Even just a few days away with friends made the stressful reality of day to day life a little more tolerable.",,"[0.018935071, 0.007916853, -0.041277476, 0.011887503, -2.3514756e-05, -0.005540139,

11,Hippocorpus,"On July 20th, 2019, I got married! After all of the planning and waiting, it was wonderful. It was hot, but everything except pictures was indoors, so it wasn't too bad. We had a ceremony in the LDS temple in Logan, Utah. It was perfect. There are people who I wish had been able to attend, but I was still able to see many friends and family who I hadn't for some time. When my husband and I walked out of the temple, everyone was there to greet us and take pictures and give hugs. My husband looked perfect in his charcoal grey tux, and we couldn't stop smiling the whole time. We hired a photographer to take pictures, but my grandpa's a photographer too, so he buzzed around and took a lot of photos too. We had a reception afterwards in the Riverwoods conference center. Our reception hall turned out really beautiful, and our parents said the sweetest things. I got to meet one of my husband's sisters for the first time. A couple who my family knew when we lived in Dubai several years ago even came! Some other friends from overseas were able to attend as well, so I was really great to see them again. Everything went really smoothly, and I think everyone had a wonderful time.","On July 20th, 2019, I got married! After all of the planning and waiting, it was wonderful.

12,Hippocorpus,"I recently was involved in a short relationship with a wonderful man. We hit it off well and got close quickly, but it soon became very clear that he doesn't have any time for me in his life. I talked to him about how I was feeling and he tried to understand and do what he could, but ultimately there was just no way forward. After barely hearing from him for a couple days, I messaged him to tell him that I wanted to make it work and I tried, but it was clear that it wasn't possible and I couldn't be his girlfriend. He agreed that there was nothing he could do to change his situation and how it related to me and our potential together and that it made sense to end it. Although I wasn't expecting anything different, it hurt a lot that I could see he hadn't actually put any effort in, other than deciding to tell me he loves me, and that he so easily let go of the possibility of having any future. He was the one who insisted we try to be together, despite the obvious challenges. I feel even more like he doesn't care about my feelings or find them valid, because I told him I was concerned we weren't on the same page since the very beginning, and he insisted we were. I cried in the bathroom at work until I could finally pull myself back together. Meanwhile, he decided that the idea that we would be friends instead should start right away and sent me several messages complaining about his job. I had to tell him that I'm sorry he's frustrated at work and I care for him, it seemed really tone deaf at the moment and that I needed a beat before I could swoop into the role of providing him with emotional labor while getting nothing in return. I didn't say it in those words, but that's how I felt and it's just a new level of pain, because did he actually ever care, or did he just like someone caring about him? I feel like this is just another example of the fact that I will never meet anyone and I will spend the rest of my life alone. This was the best anything I've found in three years, I don't feel good about the future. ","I recently was involved in a short relationship with a wonderful man.

13,Hippocorpus,"I came home to a great surprise. My husband, family and close friends were in my backyard with the scent of ribs rushing to my nostrils. Everyone shouted surprise, hugs and kisses came towards me one after the other. I had just graduated and recieved my masters degree in criminology. I did not recieve a party when I got my bachelors so I really was not expecting one now. My parents with tears of joy mentioned how long they have been planning the party and how hard it was to keep my husband from letting out the secret. My husband while laughing mentioned how it was the hardest thing to do because i am always being noisy. They prepared all my favorite foods; jerked chicken, ribs, curried mutton, hotdogs fries and cheesecake. They had the right playlist and decors in my favorite colors. In the center of the yard was a table with gift boxes and cards. I was overwhelmed and still in disbelief as i have never had something like this, so much joy and pride in one place at the same time. Eveyone was talking and laughing, kids running around the yard. I grabbed my plate and feasted upon the food they had prepared. I ate, drank and danced and at the end of the night we played games and i opened my gifts. I received gift cards for my favorite restuarants, cash, jewelry and the greatest of all a new car from my husband, I could not hold back the tears as it burst from my eyes. This was definitely one of the most memorable moments of my life.","I came home to a great surprise.

14,Hippocorpus,"Six months ago I graduated from college. This moment was memorable because I was finally closing a chapter in my life that had taken so much of my time. I remember getting ready that day. I woke up early because I wanted to do my hair and makeup. I wanted to have the time to make it perfect. But, I quickly realized not everything was going to turn out perfect when my hair would just not curl. The time was already to go and I didn't have my dress on or my makeup up done. As the clock zoomed by, I was in a crying fit as my mom rushed me into my dress and I walked to the car with no shoes on and no makeup. Already a day I had dreamed about, planned out so perfectly was already ruined. I knew it I could feel it deep in my gut. The icing on the cake was when I arrived to the arena in my four inch heels and realized the floor was completely concrete, and I would have to stand for hours on it. This day could not have turned out worse. I just wanted to go home and get my diploma in the mail. I realized this event was not for me. I wasn't doing it for me. I was just happy to graduate and wanted to take a nap after a long 18 credit semester. I was doing all this for my family. But this moment made me realize that moments you dream about don't always turn out as planned.","Six months ago I graduated from college.

However, we found out in march that we were pregnant! I can't begin to describe the excitement that I felt when I found out we were having a baby. I was so happy to find this news out as was my family! Then a couple months later we found out we were having a girl!! At first I was scared because being a guy I knew I didn't know all the ins and outs of what a girl goes through. The one thing I knew for sure was that there was nobody that would love this girl more than I do! I can't wait for her to get here. My wife and I decided on a name right away. We came to the decision rather easily without much fuss. It's a name that we have liked for some time now. My mom is also very excited about it, because my nieces from my sister are getting older now. So it'll be nice for her to have a baby to care for. Again this is probably the biggest moment of my life let alone the last 6 months.","The biggest thing to happen to me is finding out I am going to be a father.

16,Hippocorpus,"This year both of my kids are in school. Although my older son was in school the past two years, part time and then a full day, I always had my youngest with me. I can't remember the last time I was consistently alone, well I can but it was about five years ago. Their dad works full time and is almost never home, and never does anything related to school activities. The first day was crazy for me. I drove to my oldest son's school and got him settled with her and made sure he was comfortable and confident starting Kindergarten. I hightailed in out of there back to the car and got my youngest back in his seat and booked it to his school. Of course we live in a ridiculous town which hasn't done construction work all summer, yet they chose the first day of school to close down the roads surrounding two of our biggest schools. I was already rushing because my sons are supposed to be at their school 5 minutes apart and that's not even humanly possible, although I'll still always try. Finally got to my second son's school and got inside to find his teachers, get him all signed in and I just made it in time. I said goodbye and felt bad for all the parents whose kids were screaming, crying, hitting because they didn't want to leave their parents or go to school. My son walked out with his class and I left the building. All these other parents were crying and visibly upset about leaving their kids at school, I literally walked out the door, stood still for a moment and took a deep breath. I finally was alone, and it was going to happen again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. I felt guilty all the other moms were looking at me like I'm a lunatic because I'm relieved and not bawling my eyes out. But honestly to each their own, and if they had my kids instead of theirs I can tell you they'd be the one breathing a sigh of relief. For the first time in five years, I have time alone.","This year both of my kids are in school.

17,Hippocorpus,"A few weeks ago my boyfriend found out his roommate was going to be moving out. He was telling me about it, acting kind of nervous. We were having dinner together, we had ordered food to his apartment, and having a nice night together. He then stops eating, puts down his fork and turns to me. He tells me that things have been going really well with us and he's been thinking about this for awhile. He says that we spend most nights at the same apartment anyway, and, while it's not the reason he's asking, with his roommate moving out it just makes the most sense to move in together. He reassures me that he's not asking because it's convenient for him, but that he's been wanting to and it's just practical to do it now. We have been dating for about 2 years, and I had been thinking about taking that step too. I tell him that I think it sounds perfect, that I had been thinking about it too. We spend the night talking about how we'll handle it. We discuss where we'll live, if we'll take one of our current apartments or find a new one. We decide to both live at his current apartment, it's bigger than mine since I lived alone and in a good area that is convenient for both of us. It felt so good to be taking this step with him. He doesn't always like to talk about feeling so this shows me where he stand with me and our relationship. I don't remember being that happy for a long time.","A few weeks ago my boyfriend found out his roommate was going to be moving out. He was telling me about it, acting kind of nervous.

18,Hippocorpus,"I experienced my first train ride with my daughter approximately three months ago. We rode from Tennessee to Utah to visit my sister and her husband. Our adventure started in Nashville as a bus trip, and when we arrived in Indiana, we transferred ourselves and our luggage on a train. The bus trip was a little cramped, but amusing. A male passenger across from me kept cursing during his phone conversation. The bus driver had no qualms with correcting the young man's outbursts. Later during the drive, the bus driver attempted her best to not doze off. During the last leg of the trip she swerved a few times. To keep herself awake, she started to hum. The bus driver hummed louder and louder as we progressed closer and closer to the bus/train station. I was amused to the point of giggling. My daughter was not. My daughter didn't get much sleep the night before our trip, and she had hoped she would make up for it during our bus ride. When my daughter and I ended our bus trip and arrived in Indiana, we experienced a dull four hour layover. Maybe it was dull because it was the wee-hours of the morning. But she and I amused ourselves by cracking jokes and making silly comments. After the long four hours, we finally boarded the train and had begun our cozy and adventurous ride to Utah. Our first stop was in Chicago. My daughter and I had to transfer ourselves and our luggage to another train. The customer service gentleman who assisted us with the transfer was kind, comedic and inquisitive. He and I exchanged jests and sarcasms after he made an inquiry concerning our reasons for going to Utah. The customer service gentleman also joked about the size of my daughter's luggage. He stated that he was sure that he would be able to fit inside of the suitcase and tag along with us. My daughter and I were refreshed by the comical exchange with the customer service gentleman. After transferring our luggage, my daughter and I discovered the food court in the train station ate a delicious meal, and then made our way to the Chicago train station waiting area to begin the last half of our adventure.","I experienced my first train ride with my daughter approximately three months ago.

19,Hippocorpus,"I recently completed a project at work that did not go as planned. Before I started working for the company as a project coordinator, my boss had coordinated a fundraising effort to raise money for a well to be built on campus. The well was supposed to yield 3600 gallons of water every week. We had a biologist come out to see the land and confirm this amount. I was brought on to help finish the project. I felt a little uneasy about managing a project that was going to cost the company so much money, but I was glad to know my boss was looking forward to this. I would have been more nervous if I had to make the final decisions, but basically everything had already been predetermined for me; who were we going to hire, how it was going to get done, etc. I felt like I did a very good job keeping all the pieces moving. I didn't rush anyone, but through good communication, asking for updates, frequent reminders, and a smiling face, the project got done on time and under budget! I don't think I cut any corners. But the well is not producing 3600 gallons every week. It's only producing 300 gallons, nearly a tenth of what we'd been told. I don't think this is my fault, but I am now trying to figure out a reasonable explanation so my boss is not surprised. It just goes to show once again that it's important to manage expectations.","I recently completed a project at work that did not go as planned.

20,Hippocorpus,"This happened about a month ago. I was outside with my daughter and she was playing with her friends and trying to learn how to ride a bike. I was looking at the next parking lot over and saw a few young kids riding their scooters and bikes on the side walk but going into the parking lot as well. I couldn't see anyone watching them and people zoom around here in all parking lots. I was paying attention to my daughter when I heard a loud thud. I knew instantly what it was. Some young kid in his supped up car smacked into one of the girls. I called 911 as I was running over. The kid didn't even get out of the car. I stood behind him while talking to the operator in attempts to not let him leave. The kid was screaming. I think she broke her arm, and the mom finally makes her way outside. She's with her kid screaming as I'm talking and waiting. The cops show up a few minutes later before the ambulance and take over. It was crazy but the girl in the end was in a cast. It could have went a lot worse. I'm kind of glad we have nothing going on in this town because the police were there in minutes.","This happened about a month ago.

21,Hippocorpus,"Just last week I bought a house. I had been looking for something local that I could purchase that would fit my budget with not a lot of money down. I decided that I would make a home purchase of a double wide in my local manufactured home community. I signed the papers and felt a rush of excitement that I was finally going to be a homeowner. The most memorable part was when they handed me the keys and said this is now your new home. I couldn't believe it was actually ours. I wanted to find something that was large enough for my family, but that wouldn't be much upkeep. We are extremely busy people. The home is brand new from the factory and so is everything in it. So this is perfect for what we are looking for, and it is all ours. Very exciting! I can't believe that we are actually home owners. While the searching wasn't the most fun part, and we are still moving, getting to have our own home is super exciting. I can't believe it is ours. I can't believe that everything worked out and we have a place of our own.","Just last week I bought a house.

22,Hippocorpus,"A very significant day in my life in the last few months was my wedding day in June. We had been engaged for almost 9 months, and I had been stressfully planning for the last 9 months. The day before the wedding started off stressful. We had an issue at the rehearsal dinner with our Officiant complaining and not being very supportive of all of the changing circumstances. He made me so mad because he was making the day all about him and how it wasn't easy for him, but it's our big day! I finally snapped, then went outside with my maid of honor to calm down. He finally apologized, then we went home to rest before the big day! The day of the wedding I woke up early because I couldn't sleep from excitement! I went to breakfast and met my bridesmaids and mother there. I could barely eat, but managed to have a biscuit and some eggs. We then went to the salon and it took almost four hours to get all of our hair and makeup done. We had a delicious Thai lunch, which was perfect, because that's some of my favorite food. We then got ready and headed over the venue. It was so crazy hot, so I was standing in front of the fan and putting my feet in ice water to try to stay cool! We got our photos done, behind schedule, but finally it was time to head inside for the ceremony. People started arriving, but right at the time the ceremony was supposed to start, we had a huge thunderstorm! My husband had to run around getting everyone to help bring chairs inside. Luckily, the weather cleared shortly and we were able to get everything set up again and the ceremony started. It was beautiful, with a rainbow overhead and the bright sun coming out. Overall, it was a very special day and I'm so happy to be married now!","A very significant day in my life in the last few months was my wedding day in June.

23,Hippocorpus,"Recently my oldest son graduated High School. It was an amazing day and I couldn't have been more proud of him and his accomplishments. It was especially emotional for me because he didn't have a typical start in life. I was 19 when I had him and I was a single parent so it was sometimes a struggle. I wanted him to always know I loved him and to fight for everything in life no matter what your circumstances are. The whole day was full of love, laughter, family, stories, pictures, and great food. My son stood tall and proud on the stage as he received his diploma and when he saw us in the crowd he smiled just for us. We had a party afterwards and tons of his friends came to see him and give him gifts. He also had a lot of family in town for the party including people from out of state that hadn't seen him since he was a baby. The only bittersweet thing about the whole day was that his biological father didn't come to see him. That was a tough pill to swallow, but my son made it. And for that I'm always going to be proud. He has his diploma now and can move on to college. He is grown up and I have done my job to get him out into the world. I will miss his teenage years (somewhat), but I am proud of him.","Recently my oldest son graduated High School.

That was a tough pill to swallow, but my son made it. And for that I'm always going to be proud. He has his diploma now and can move on to college. He is grown up and I have done my job to get him out into the world. I will miss his teenage years (somewhat), but I am proud of him.",,"[-0.04487217, 0.05029162, 0.023996027, -0.041011322, 0.030359257, -0.06343806, -0.04383055, -0.025700016, 0.004990796, 0.01231139,

24,Hippocorpus,"So about 3 months ago I broke up with my boyfriend. Again. Well, I didn't break up with him, he broke up with me, but I technically broke up with him the first time. It's complicated. Anyway, he had been really mean to me for a while, ever since we started dating--but I'm really soft. When I see someone show emotion, like cry or something, I immediately change my perspective on them. I become a 'protector', or 'fixer', I guess? I wanted to help him get better. He sold me a lot of sob stories about his parents, and I ate it up. So, he became my best friend. I let it happen, because I cared about him a lot at that point. Psychologically, it ruined me. I became depressed and dependent. I used to not care what anyone thought about me, but I became obsessed. The event from 3 months ago was mind crushing, though. He told me how he just used me, how I was just ""addicted' to him, called me sexist names and how everyone was using me and how I was dependent on others for validation. I've never been one to care about what others think about me. I'm extremely independent, I work for my own money (we're college students), and I don't really have parents who are present. But he called me dependent and a 'drain' on his wallet, despite the fact I had spent a ton of money on him, too, despite having less. I would pay for his haircuts, his food, whenever he didn't have the money I'd spot him immediately. He never had a job, it was his parent's money and I was working 3 jobs at the peak of our relationship. I guess I'm still a little angry about it?","So about 3 months ago I broke up with my boyfriend. Again.

25,Hippocorpus,"I took my dogs outside as normal and noticed Buttons was slower than usual. We got her in 2005 and she had been diagnosed with heart trouble. As we called her back in, she turned and looked at my mother then ran off into the dark. We waited and waited for them to come back and when we heard our little mini-pin cry out,I had a horrible feeling. I stepped onto the lawn and noticed Buttons lying in her favorite spot with Sparky at her side. She had laid down where she loved and quietly passed away. I picked her up and felt her limpness and I knew she was gone. It was such a horrible feeling. She was our last link to the old life we had when my father was alive. He had loved her so much and the last thing he told us was to take care of her. Buttons was with me when I went through cancer and his loss. She was with me throughout the last fourteen years and I loved her so much. I think that losing her has had a profound effect on me because in some way it was the end of an era. It was the end of the life in Idaho living on a farm. It was the end of days and days of her waiting for me. I think that the day we took her to be cremated was one of the most painful days. Even now, I still cry about it. I guess the comfort I feel is that she died on a beautiful night, in her favorite spot next to Sparky and that was a really nice way to go. I miss her so much but I have to let her go.","I took my dogs outside as normal and noticed Buttons was slower than usual. We got her in 2005 and she had been diagnosed with heart trouble.

26,Hippocorpus,"I was with Mike, a white male, 45 years old, who was a very good friend from work. We were at a Mexican restaurant where my husband and I go, frequently. There are some very nice people who work there and they all know me by sight and are always smiling and friendly. Mike, along with several other co-workers, and I went to this restaurant because I suggested it would be a great place to have lunch. As usual, everything was going great. The employees were friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Towards the end of our lunch, it started getting really busy. We were almost done eating and wanted to get our sopapillas and our check so we could get back to work. There was a busboy running around trying to keep ahead of all the customers so Mike decides to get the busboy's attention. He yells out, ""Hey, Pedro!"" to this young kid. I was absolutely mortified. I asked what he was doing and he said he calls all Hisphanic guys, Pedro. He didn't see anything wrong with it. I did tell him how insensitive his remark was but he thought I was being overly-sensitive. I wanted to crawl under a rock. When we were leaving, I apologized to the young busboy and to everyone else I could see. When we got back to work, we continued to discuss the issue and I don't think I ever got through to him. I have never felt the same about him from that day forward. I know he felt the same about me.","I was with Mike, a white male, 45 years old, who was a very good friend from work.

27,Hippocorpus,"Monday my daughter started “Big Girl School”!!! She has official entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn’t new to her though. She has been in Pre-K for a year so she is used to getting up, putting on a uniform and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten. I however am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7PM and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional “Wake Up Song”. I’ve been singing her this song since she was a baby, this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a ""big kid"" Sometimes she sings along…sometimes she pulls the covers over her head. I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon and fruit. Every once in a while I will let her eat her favorite cereal but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I reckon she was nervous. So we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunch box that looks like a purse and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time and I walked her inside. The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down and she covered her face!!! Later she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!! Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!","Monday my daughter started “Big Girl School”!!! She has official entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn’t new to her though.

28,Hippocorpus,"I was sexually abused as a child so anything sexual has been attached to shame and guilt. I felt gross whenever I masturbated or touched myself, it felt awful. Then a few days ago, I'm not sure why it happened, but I told myself that my sexuality was mine and that I'm entitled to it, that I shouldn't feel ashamed of it. It clicked and it felt like the shame was gone. I felt happy and empowered. I started crying and giggling at the same time, it was like a huge weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I felt really good to finally be able to own something that was mine to begin with. I even felt angry that it was taken from me for so long, but angry in a good way. Angry that I had parts of myself taken away from me to begin with. It was a really confusing set of emotions. It felt really good though. I owned those feelings, they were mine. I finally felt like I was entitled to them. It was like a lid came off of me and everything came pouring out. I've been working through a lot in my past and it feels wonderful to see my progress.","I was sexually abused as a child so anything sexual has been attached to shame and guilt.

29,Hippocorpus,"My wedding was on July 31st of this year. It was absolutely magical. We had rented a ranch in Colorado surrounded by mountains for the week for our family and friends to stay at. This was also the place where we held our wedding ceremony and reception. It felt more special than any other wedding because it was mine and I was surrounded by the people who mattered most to not only me but my husband. We had the ceremony in the backyard of the ranch, overlooking the mountains next to us. We could hear the river flowing below us as we recited our vows we wrote to each other. I will never forget seeing my husband’s face when I walked to him down the aisle. I knew I was marrying the right man when I took the tears from his eyes. The most magical part of the wedding was after our ceremony. We just barely had enough time to finish family photos before it started to rain over the mountains. We all ran inside and then to the pavilion. I remember standing there looking at the rain coming over the mountains and I was in awe. Standing there with my family and friends and new husband meant the world to me because I had just started the new chapter of my life and I had them all with me. The rain was breathtaking. I knew the rain signified that our relationship would last through anything and I constantly look back at that moment as my favorite. We had spent months and years planning this wedding and it was definitely the most significant aspect of my life to date. I would love to write about this event in the future.","My wedding was on July 31st of this year. It was absolutely magical.

30,Hippocorpus,"A couple weeks ago for July 4th, we went up to Hiawassee, Georgia, a small mountain town on the border of North Carolina and Georgia. My sister and I were visiting our grandparents to celebrate 4th of July together. Their house was situated on a quiet cove of a lake. This lake is generally what Hiawassee has come to be known for, as it is often covered in boats and recreations. Beautiful houses line the shores of the lake and make it feel magical of sorts. The holiday comes around and as is tradition for those on the lake, everyone takes their boats out to another quiet cove and waits. We wait for fireworks, launched off by the city just after the moon rises. The fireworks the previous year were notably short to the disbelief of the boat goers. However this year the city had certainly made up for it with what was maybe an hour long show. It was truly incredible. American music was being played from boats in every direction. You could hear the audible gasps and excitement with each new firework. It truly was an incredible sight and time. Afterwards, many people hung around on their boats talking with friends and even swimming in the black of night softly lit by boat lights. I'm definitely going back again.","A couple weeks ago for July 4th, we went up to Hiawassee, Georgia, a small mountain town on the border of North Carolina and Georgia.

31,Hippocorpus,"Today we laid my mother in law to rest. The funeral was beautiful and very tasteful. There were so many people there. Friends, family, club members, dancers, neighbors, people from church. I will miss her dearly as she was my best friend for 20 years. I still cannot believe she is gone. Cancer sucks!! Many of the people there made a donation to animal shelters. She was so passionate about animals. She was well loved and will be missed. The service the pastor gave was so elegant and appropriate for the occasion. It will be a day I will remember for a long time. She will never be forgotten. The weather was beautiful. I enjoyed the service. Funerals are often depressing but hers was very nice.","Today we laid my mother in law to rest. The funeral was beautiful and very tasteful. There were so many people there.

32,Hippocorpus,"Five months ago, my life turned upside down when my mother passed away from a terminal cancer. Losing her was completely shocking and unexpected. She was young, full of life and had a heart of gold that touched everyone who ever came to know her. She was my confidant and the best grandmother to my young daughter, I could not imagine living the rest of my life without her unconditional love and support. I never liked May, especially because my birthday was in May and the day was always bitter-sweet for me. Although my mother always made it special, I felt sad because I never had any childhood friends to share it with. Now May took on an entirely different meaning, May was the month when my mother left this world forever, I would be left orphaned. I wanted to fill the last days of her life with as much love and peace as possible to repay her back for all the love and sacrifices that she did for me while I was growing up. I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings, it seemed like she could go at any moment, however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday. It was the most important day of her life and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly master any strength, she even signed my birthday card with three simple and yet most powerful words: "" I love you!"". I cried as I held her in my arms. She feel asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand. I cannot describe the pain of that parting, however, God's strength and my family were the only things that carried me through. At her funeral, my three-year-old daughter came up to me suddenly and said : ""Don't be sad Mommy, you have my love forever"". These words made my heart melt and I then understood ever so clearly that life can be summarized in three simple words : ""I love you"", just as my mother said to me before her passing. Those words can never die or be erased.","Five months ago, my life turned upside down when my mother passed away from a terminal cancer. Losing her was completely shocking and unexpected.

33,Hippocorpus,"On may 21 of this year (2019), my very first niece had his 15 years old birthday celebration. Since she was a little baby I was waiting for this moment, because she has a personality that makes me feel like I have my sister back when she was young. That is because of several reasons. My sister is no longer with us, and she is like the memory we have about my sister. Now why that date was so important for me? Well, I am not exactly in my home country. I am living abroad because of my career, but for that date I wanted to jump from my place to her place, just because I cannot miss that once in a life event for my niece. I bought a flight ticket, I had a layover for about 12 hours in another country, I got sick because of the meal, but you know what? I don't regret at all. At the end of the day I saw her face, I saw how happy she was in her party celebration, and also she was happy to see me there. I could dance with my little niece, which is my little baby as well , and I will remember that for the rest of my life. I said to her that when I was in the airplane, I saw her mother in the sky, she told me to carry her, and said I love you on behalf of her. My niece was so happy, she hugged me and I whispered: your mother is so proud of you honey. I am pretty sure my sister was also dancing in the heaven. The night was too short, but the memories are infinites, because each second was valuable. I have to travel back the next day, without anything in my bags, but my heart full of love. Family is the treasure that will always makes your life valuable.","On may 21 of this year (2019), my very first niece had his 15 years old birthday celebration.

34,Hippocorpus,"There was a recent event that happened last Tuesday that was pretty interesting and memorable. I was shopping in a grocery store and there was quite a few people there that day. When I was shopping, I went to grab a griddle, but as I grabbed it there was a woman right behind me who started questioning me and cussing me out for taking the last available griddle. I had to defend my purchase, so I just ignored her and kept shopping. Later on, I left my cart alone and noticed that the woman took my griddle out of my shopping cart, which pretty infuriating. I secretly ""stole"" it back into my cart without her noticing and watched her checkout without realizing it was gone. I felt bad but at the same time I found the griddle first. I wish that I could have seen her realize that she didn't have the griddle in the parking lot but I didn't get the chance to see this woman again. I felt proud that I was able to get the last griddle and I have no regrets. I think it is absolutely ridiculous to get angry at a stranger for something like that. If possible, I would have recorded this situation and uploaded it because I just think it's funny. Anyway, the griddle works perfectly and for only $20 I am satisfied with my purchase. I made pancakes with it this morning and some eggs. I still think about it though with some shame. I hate being mean to people but this was my griddle, once again.","There was a recent event that happened last Tuesday that was pretty interesting and memorable.

All the cheering and support bought tears to my eyes. It was happy and sad tears.

36,Hippocorpus,"I am pregnant, and with that has come all sorts of thrills and fears. Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. I became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though. I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. In that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head. This was a beautiful moment in our relationship and in my pregnancy.","I am pregnant, and with that has come all sorts of thrills and fears.

37,Hippocorpus,"The event that I remember the most is the death of my uncle whom I was very close to. He got very sick with pneumonia, and went to the hospital. When he was in the hospital they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. While he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath. I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years. Life goes on, but it certainly will be a lot sadder without him.","The event that I remember the most is the death of my uncle whom I was very close to.

38,Hippocorpus,"My teenage daughter told me two days ago that she is bisexual. I am a very conservative, religious person, and she has always gone to church and expressed similar values, so this was a shock. She didn't know how to tell me, so she wrote a note and gave it to me. After reading it, I just hugged her and held her and told her I would always love her. We both cried for a long time. It is so hard growing up today. There are so many confusing messages coming from so many different places. It is a scary world, and the one place a kid should feel safe and accepted is at home. I hope my daughter always feels that way. She said her biggest fear was that we would treat her differently now. I told her we might have to muddle through some awkward questions and conversations together, but that I will be here to support her health and happiness. I think all moms worry about whether they are good enough or if there was some point in some area where they failed their kids. I am wrestling with these questions now. I have a renewed determination to be connected and present with my kids. I think our family can and will grow stronger and closer.","My teenage daughter told me two days ago that she is bisexual.

39,Hippocorpus,"A big chunk of my family attended the ELO concert in Atlanta on July 5th of this year. I come from a very large family (I'm the youngest of 7) and there were 10 of us total who attended the concert. It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT. It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. This event was also memorable for one other reason. My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale. He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife. She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live. Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert. She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm. She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late. She passed away that night. We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable. My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away. He said it just didn't feel right. After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go. His oldest son took her place. It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed. We miss her terribly - and we will always miss her terribly - and the concert was dedicated to her.","A big chunk of my family attended the ELO concert in Atlanta on July 5th of this year.

We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable. <br><br>My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away. He said it just didn't feel right. After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go. His oldest son took her place. It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed. <br><br>We miss her terribly - and we will always miss her terribly - and the concert was dedicated to her.",,"[-0.049458243, 0.040327985, -0.015618368, 0.06818748, 0.00047630718, -0.04513736, -0.052239098, -0.026073992, -0.009220887, 0.037883807, -0.07592685, 0.011445866, -0.038481433, 0.004687057,

40,Hippocorpus,"I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention. This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come. The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry, and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low. The funds, I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation. Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place. I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot of money for many years. The confidence I had in my driving has still not come back, and this makes me feel like I lack ability and weak-minded. I hope this passes, because I do not like feeling worse about my life. I will have to work on getting my confidence back, and reducing the amount of daily worry I have. This was not a great day or experience, and has definitely impacted my life each day since August 5th, but I think it will pass soon and I can have finally my mind and confidence back.","I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention.

41,Hippocorpus,"In late May of 2019 I had an overdose at a unexpected time in my life. I was going through many things such as my mother being in a comatose state, me losing my job, and falling in love with someone who didn't deserve me. During this time I fell back deeply in love with something other than myself or another person. I fell back on something that was dependable and reliant. I fell back on drugs. I knew that it would happen to someone, but never that it would happen to me. I couldn't bring myself to believe that I would someday need Naloxone to be revived from the point of death twice. The effects of the drugs started to happen around 7:00 pm est when I started to go into a heavy sleep. My friend pulled the car over to assist me in waking up and start CPR on me until the ambulance arrived. It took the ambulance about 15 minutes to get there, and to administer the Naloxone. At this point I was unconscious with no pulse until the Naloxone was administered. Once inside of the ambulance I died once more with no pulse until the EMT attendants started CPR and resuscitated me. I ended up going to the nearest hospital which was about 25 minutes away. I was kept in isolation for about six hours while the nurses and doctors ran test on me. I ended up having side effects from the situation. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, collapsed lungs, and bruised lungs. I was released from the hospital that night, but had to return for a two day stay at the commonwealth hospital. I had never felt so drained in my life before until this moment where I felt like I could just rest, and finally be safe.","In late May of 2019 I had an overdose at a unexpected time in my life.

42,Hippocorpus,"Over the Memorial Day holiday in the United States, my family of 12 and I went on a family vacation. We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. This vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. There were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. Every morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. That evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. After everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying. Nope, FOOD POISONING!!! While it was not funny at the time because I was literally thinking that I was dying, I look back now and laugh because everyone talks about me getting food poisoning and the shape that I was in. Lucky for them, I took one for the team.","Over the Memorial Day holiday in the United States, my family of 12 and I went on a family vacation.

43,Hippocorpus,"Just this past Wednesday on August the 21st I performed at my Grandfathers funeral. He was 91 and an inspiration to me. I am actually his name sake and named after him. It was a great honer to do his eulogy and cover the wonderful accomplishments of such a great man that I have looked up to my entire life. All of my family were in attendance, which was a great thing as most of us haven't seen one another in many years. My grandfather always cared about family and made family the point and purpose of his life. Unfortunately, it required his passing to remind us of the that value. He fathered six children and had 9 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren and they were all in attendance to honor his home going! Just two years before, in the same month I did my father's funeral and everyone was in attendance there as well. I mention this because at my grandfather's funeral the place was packed, save one empty chair. It was a touching thought that there was one chair left in honor of my father. I mentioned this in the eulogy and hoped that all in the family who know that there is a chair in our home and at the table for every one of them! During the funeral I preached a message as well on the lives that are lived as an anchor for others. My Grandfather was most certainly an anchor for all of us as well as grandpa and grandmas house was an anchor for our souls when traveling into town. I also expressed how our faith anchors us in the decisions that we make in life. That many time we can drift too far off course and that life has a way of blowing from our course through storms. Although the winds of life are experienced by everyone, we do not have to allow them to shipwreck us or our faith. Through faith and trust we hold on and are anchored to the rock! This was the way that my grandpa lived and that is the way that I hope to live my life as well. In all it was a bitter sweet event for me and there were tears of sadness and of joy. I am glad that my family trusted me to minister to all in this trying time. I was very humbled and honored to do it.","Just this past Wednesday on August the 21st I performed at my Grandfathers funeral. He was 91 and an inspiration to me.

44,Hippocorpus,"I have been dating Michelle for nearly three years. In June we went to Rome, Italy for a week long vacation she had booked for us. It was a trip of a lifetime for me as I had rarely traveled anywhere outside of the United States. We left Dallas and flew to London for a 6 hour layover. It was long enough where we could leave the airport and experience a little of the area before flying on to Rome. After a few days in Rome touring all of the sites I had only read about we had dinner at an extremely fancy restaurant. It was there that my life changed for the better. I was widowed about ten years ago and I didn't think I would ever marry again. Much to my surprise Michelle proposed to me. I know it isn't the traditional way this was supposed to work but I was floored. My heart and mind were racing that I don't even remember saying yes but she said I accepted right away. The look on her face made me the happiest man in the world. I truly believe we were destined to be together but it took me some nudging to make me realize it for real. For the rest of the trip I was walking on air. I have finally found happiness in my life again. I felt like the luckiest person on earth.","I have been dating Michelle for nearly three years.

45,Hippocorpus,"Today I got to take part in a celebration to mark Nick & Bec's 20 Anniversary. I was asked to be part of the ceremony by writing and presenting 5 Haikus about their relationship. When I got to the party, I was amazed at the number of old friends of mine that were also attending the event. I knew at least 45 of the 50 or so attendees, although there were some folks I hadn't seen in years. The party gave me an unexpeected chance to catch up with so many of these old friends. It was so nice to see so many people I love and to get to celebrate one of my favorite couples with them all. It also was very energizing to have so many friends together and it made me feel very happy and grateful I have so many amazing people in my life. It's hard not to be happy when you realized you are so blessed. The ceremony itself was beautiful. Both the bride and groom looked lovely and were happy and upbeat. Everyone seemed to be in a great and appreciative mood and the ceremony went off without a hitch. My haikus were well received, and people laughed and ""ahhhed"" at all the points I had hoped they would. It made me feel very special that I was only 1 of 2 people who had been asked to contribute and speak at the ceremony, and I was grateful I got to contribute. After the ceremony, the food and reception were also fabulous. I stayed at the party almost 4 hours before heading home. Even then it was hard to leave because there were so many folks I wanted more time to catch up with. I went home happy and energized by all the friendship and love from the night.","Today I got to take part in a celebration to mark Nick & Bec's 20 Anniversary.

46,Hippocorpus,"About four months ago, my wife and I sold our first family home. We have a large family. It is my wife and I plus five children. Our oldest daughter started asking us about having her own room. Although we loved that house, we knew it was time to get something bigger. Luckily, we sold it after being on the market for only three days. We found a house with more bedrooms quickly, and the whole process was as smooth as it could have been. However, it is bittersweet looking back on everything. That house was very special to me. I did a lot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learn and love there. We made so many good memories. We charted how our children grew on a closet door (which is probably still there). It was a wonderful house while it lasted, but things happen and we had to let it go. As of today, I can still remember every little nook and cranny of that place. After all, it has only been a few months. However, it is sad to think these memories will eventually fade. I love our new house, but that first one will always hold a special place in my heart.","About four months ago, my wife and I sold our first family home. We have a large family.

47,Hippocorpus,"A week ago, I was having pain in my back. I thought it was just normal wear and tear until the pain got worse in the afternoon. It was so sharp and felt like something was squeezing on my insides. It no longer seemed like it was routine back pain so I decided to go to the emergency room. It took forever for someone to see me, and I was worried because the pain continued. A nurse came in to see me, asked what my symptoms were, and then told me I would need to undergo some tests. I waited some more hours before the big scanning machine was available. The scan was painless, and after I was done, I went to use the bathroom since I was told the doctor would come talk to me soon. I immediately felt the pain disappear after using the bathroom. When I was waiting for the doctor, a nurse came in the room and told me the doctor would be in shortly, she was just on the phone with the radiologist. I immediately felt panic set in. Why would she be talking to a radiologist? I thought the worst and believed that I must have had something very seriously wrong with me. I started to think of all of the things I was going to miss out in life, and felt extremely sad and hopeless. When the doctor arrived, she didn't have a gloomy expression on her face, so I felt hopeful. She said that I had kidney stones. I immediately felt better, even though kidney stones are serious. I didn't know that radiologists look over all the scans the machine does. I thought they only got involved if it was a very serious disease. I told her that I felt better after using the bathroom, and she said that it was possible I already passed the kidney stone. Just to be sure, she gave me medications to shrink any stones and to help heal quicker. I was so relieved after that. I felt like I had a new lease on life, and decided to commit myself to eating healthier and drinking much more water.","A week ago, I was having pain in my back.

48,Hippocorpus,"After two attempts at taking the law school admissions test, I had received a respectable score. I took several weeks to craft a personal statement to send to three law schools. I waited until the last possible day, of each law school's admission cycle, to submit my applications. One law school rejected me; it was the highest ranking school. Over the next two weeks, the other two law schools both accepted me and offered me 60% scholarships to attend their programs. Unfortunately, both schools offered these scholarships with conditions. The conditions seemed completely attainable- do not fall below the bottom 20% of the class, for one, and to stay above a 2.33 GPA for the other. Both of the schools that accepted me were relatively high-ranking schools. The dean of the higher ranking of the two schools requested a conference with me to discuss my options and any concerns I might have. Initially, that school had offered me a 40% scholarship but during this conversation the dean raised my scholarship offer from 40% to 60%, unsolicited. I attempted at that time to further negotiate my scholarship details- the conditions only. The dean expressed he would bring my concerns up with the admissions committee and contact me back with a determination. The admissions committee sent out my revised scholarship offer soon after, however the conditions were still attached. After long consideration, I withdrew my applications from both law schools. My goal was and continues to be to obtain 100% scholarship for law school. I will be retaking the LSAT and reapplying earlier in the upcoming cycle.","After two attempts at taking the law school admissions test, I had received a respectable score.

49,Hippocorpus,"My husband and I tried to help his brother get off drugs by allowing him to stay at our home for several weeks. He shoots up regularly and has damaged himself so badly that at one point doctors thought his arm might need to be amputated. His girlfriend texted me begging us to help him. At first my husband was reluctant, but I was afraid that his brother would overdose and then he would feel guilty that he hadn't helped him, so I convinced him to do it. It was a difficult time for me and my family because it's hard watching someone you care about go through such a painful experience. It disrupted our regular routine and made life more hectic. He didn't follow the house rules we set and didn't get along well with my husband while he was here. He refused to go to rehab, so even though it was hard we felt like we didn't have much choice. He got really sick while he was with us and got upset because we wouldn't help him get more drugs. He has a tendency to feel sorry for himself, which really gets on my nerves, and so the tension was high. It made life difficult for my kids, which really upset me. It was not a good time for our family and I wish now that we hadn't made the choice to invite him in because it didn't really help. He left our home and started taking drugs again and is still upset with both of us. He avoids us at family gatherings, writes unkind things about us on Facebook and acts as though it's our fault that he's still on drugs. Also, his girlfriend kicked him out and he's virtually homeless now, which he also tries to partially blame on us.","My husband and I tried to help his brother get off drugs by allowing him to stay at our home for several weeks.

50,Hippocorpus,"My 28th birthday was probably the best in my life. My cousin is 3 days younger than me and we celebrated our birthdays together. I remember that we went to our favorite park and invited lots of friends and lots of family. We had two grills cooking lots of burgers, hot dogs, different meats like steak, sausage and ribs. We all ate and laughed and played water guns, and water balloons. I got a new nintendo switch that day and so did my cousin, with the same game. The new pokemon game that came out that year. It was truly special because I have been wanting it for years and I finally gotten it. We played for hours and even had to take a break. I will never forget those moments as me and my cousin played side by side for hours on a day between our birthdays. We truly felt like we shared those moments. We caught pokemon that was different than each others and we battled them as we caught new ones. We just simply linked our gameboys and played against each other. People at the party were watching us and even rooting for me and my cousin as we had intense matches that day. All lower level pokemons. Me and my cousins are some big time fans of pokemon. The people at the party thought we were ridiculous for playing games like this but this makes us happy!","My 28th birthday was probably the best in my life.

51,Hippocorpus," Last week, I was walking down the street and I saw a man that I usually see on my way to work. Today I noticed that he was crying and looking very down. Usually I just walk past him but today I felt like I needed to talk to him. I could feel that he was going through something terrible and needed some help. I slowed down, and I stood next to him and looked at him for a moment. Finally, I mustered up the courage to ask him what was going on. He told me that he had found out that he was ill and would not have long to live. He said that he had always felt like he could manage his life the way it was. He said that after he found out this news he felt that his life was worthless. He told me that he had not wanted to eat for days and that it was hard for him to eat anyway. Due to the fact that he had very little money and very little support it was hard for him to muster up the strength to fend for himself. I sat down next to him and spoke with him for a while about what he was going through and offered to buy him something to eat. He accepted, and told me that I was the only one who had stopped and talked to him in months. He told me that it was a very helpful and that he would try and pick himself up from here on out. I felt so grateful that I had made such a big impact on him. It made me feel like I wanted to do more to help people around me. Not only was I able to uplift his spirits but my own as well.

52,Hippocorpus,"A situation that comes to mind as one that was striking and memorable happened around 2 weeks ago. I was relaxing at home, and my fiancee was in our bedroom watching TV. She called me into the room, telling me she had to show me something. I was expecting it to be a funny picture of our cat, or a video she found that I would be interested in. Instead, when I walked into the bedroom she handed me a home pregnancy test. She told me she was pregnant, she had just taken the test and wanted to tell me right away. I was so surprised. We were not really trying to get pregnant, but we were so excited right away. I couldn't believe that this was a journey we were going to start taking together. Later that night, we spent a long time sitting and talking about everything. We went over some decisions we are going to have to make for our baby, and how we would make them. She asked me for help finding a doctor and getting an appointment set up. This was all stuff that would have normally been so boring, but it wasn't. It was for our baby, so we were having fun even figuring out insurance things. Everything went by so fast, and I kept feeling more and more excited about the situation and everything that is yet to come.","A situation that comes to mind as one that was striking and memorable happened around 2 weeks ago. I was relaxing at home, and my fiancee was in our bedroom watching TV. She called me into the room, telling me she had to show me something. I was expecting it to be a funny picture of our cat, or a video she found that I would be interested in. Instead, when I walked into the bedroom she handed me a home pregnancy test. She told me she was pregnant, she had just taken the test and wanted to tell me right away. <br><br>I was so surprised. We were not really trying to get pregnant, but we were so excited right away. I couldn't believe that this was a journey we were going to start taking together. Later that night, we spent a long time sitting and talking about everything. We went over some decisions we are going to have to make for our baby, and how we would make them.

53,Hippocorpus,"A recent memorable event in my life was when I was surprised to be invited to Disney World by my mother in law. She said she would pay for everything and basically all I had to do was show up. She was meeting her daughter and granddaughter there and had enough money that I could come too. I almost didn't go because Disney World is crowded and it can be hard to hang out with a four year but I had not seen that part of the family in awhile, my schedule was clear, and it had been 12 years since I had been to Disney World. So I decided to go. My favorite days were when it was just my mother in law and I and we went to Harry Potter at Universal. The theme park was so well done and the rides were really fun and the butter beer was really good. The main big ride I ended up going by myself because my mother in law didn't want to go. It was kind of scary but it was really fun and so well done with 3D effects and lighting. It was too crowded to go wand shopping but that is okay because my husband got me a wand previously when he was in Orlando for a work trip.We also had fun with my niece, she liked anything to do with Frozen. We had lots of good food, rode on some fun rides. I liked eating at the dinosaur theme restaurant. It was basically Rainforest Cafe but with dinosaurs. The hotel we stayed in was Little Mermaid theme so that was really cute. But it was kind of noisy and the buses were far away for our hotel. Overall it was a really fun trip and I am glad I went, but I would not be going back any time soon. It is so crowded there and dealing with that many people can be really hard.","A recent memorable event in my life was when I was surprised to be invited to Disney World by my mother in law.

54,Hippocorpus,"I was on a trip to Italy and I had been thinking about past friends I had not seen recently. I was in Florence at the time and went to bed feeling a bit melancholic about these friends and past moments in my life. A few hours later I was woken up by a text from a close friend, it was the middle of the night for me but since it was someone texting from the U.S. the time was much earlier for them. The text asked if I had heard about a different friend. I immediately had a sinking feeling in my stomach. I replied that I hadn't, and immediately knew that bad news was coming. He explained that my friend had been found dead on the beach just a few short hours before. I was stunned. My mind was racing. Was this a drowning? Was it an illness? The reality was that my friend had just become another statistic in the opiate epidemic. He had died of a heroin overdose while sitting on the beach. I was devastated. I could not go to sleep and laid restless for the remainder of the night. I got up in the morning and began wandering around the city in a haze. I was on a trip of my life and I could not just sit around and mourn. However, I was tinged with sadness in everything I did. I was in one of the most beautiful cities on earth and everything was a reminder of life, death, friendship, and emotion. My eyes would well up with tears every so often as I attempted to go about my day and visit different sights. It was an unbelievably beautiful day. There was a golden sunlight touching every surface, streaming through windows. I ended the day in the 1000 year old monastery of San Miniato al Monte, thinking about life and how it was so precious and fleeting. I was filled with emotion and remembrance, knowing that I would remember this moment forever, for good and bad reasons.","I was on a trip to Italy and I had been thinking about past friends I had not seen recently.

55,Hippocorpus,"My nephew was hurt on the job, a place he goes daily with no care in the world. A place we never expected this to happen. And the seriousness of the injury was intense. Broken jaw, knocked unconcious - very much out of it and not well, he needed wires in his jaw and a very big amount of surgery. All this from being too hungry and passing out and being sick. I felt something was a tad off that night, almost a gut feeling if you will, but I didn't think anything of it, until the text messages started pouring in the next morning. I was very upset and nervous, and it brought back many bad memories and feelings of my own personal experience in 2008 - a dangerous car accident. In my accident I too suffered fractures to my face and bones. It brought back many memories from a bad time. Based on what the paramedics stated, it was a scene of horrors. Blood was everywhere, and his lip had split with his teeth actually protruding through his lower jaw. Having to be instantly sedated due to shock, he became quite sick. We all got together and prayed. It was all we could so in this situation. Thankfully, he is now on the mend. I'm his Uncle, this had a pretty profound affect on me. I was sullen and down, thinking about many things past and present. But we look forward to a bright future.","My nephew was hurt on the job, a place he goes daily with no care in the world.

56,Hippocorpus,"I have always wanted a surprise birthday celebration and sadly I have never gotten one. I just alluded it to my husband recently and I didn't know he had something in the pipeline for me. That day he was suppose to be out of town so I wasn't really expecting any surprises, I just felt it would be one of those boring birthdays when I would just receive calls from my loved ones and probably blow a cake. So after my usual day at work, where I didn't even get a happy birthday from my colleagues, I was kind of annoyed so I headed home immediately after work. As I got home I heard a thunderous happy birthday and I literally jumped out of my skin. Tears of joy kept rolling down from my eyes, my colleagues were already there. My husband just made the story of having to travel and my kids were all smiles. I was really ecstatic, what surprised me most was my parents took out time to travel for my special day even though my mum was down with stage 2 cancer. I had gifts from my husband and my friends. The love showed to me was unfathomable. I really wanted to get a necklace which I saw at a store some days back and to my surprise it was among the gifts I received. I have never had a surprise birthday party before and this was a new and exciting experience for me. I love my husband but this surprise made me love and cherish him more. I really can't wait for another birthday party. As for my kids they sang me a birthday song. This was totally the most awesome experience I have ever had.","I have always wanted a surprise birthday celebration and sadly I have never gotten one.

I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, ""well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?"" Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are ""safe"" and that we will receive help. I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward. Here is to better opportunities and a brighter future. I can't go anywhere but up from here. This is just a bump in the road.","I'm feeling lost.

Going to the impound yard was certainly a different kind of experience. I had to sue to get my money from the towing reimbursed. That was quite an experience and cost me more money. Fortunately, that was also received back by me. I could have easily lived without the whole experience. I am lucky that I was in a position of having sufficient resources, mental and monetary, to take care of the matter. Other people were not so fortunate. We are hoping to get the landlady dismissed. Actually, it would be more accurate to call her a 'property manager' although she has no license, experience, or talent in managing or property. Anyway, it was a negative couple of weeks during this time and I was quite unhappy. All's well that ends well. That's what is commonly quoted in any event.","My car was towed.

59,Hippocorpus,"I just got back from a vacation, and as is often said, I need a vacation from my vacation now! My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery. Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.","I just got back from a vacation, and as is often said, I need a vacation from my vacation now!

In the spirit of that, I wanted to pass on experiences like this to my daughter. This weekend, I decided to take a step forward to do that and bought a projector for my daughter. This projector will enable us to watch movies using a large screen or an empty wall. So, this weekend, I decided to set up a backyard movie night. I took the deck furniture and arranged it on the lawn to look like a living room. Then, I spread a moving blanket down to give us a clean area to walk. I set up a card table with the projector and DVD player along with the appropriate cords. I then put the screen together and anchored it to the ground using stakes. The screen was up against the side of the house to protect it from the wind. I tested the projector on the screen and it looked amazing. The sound quality was even good as well. Once I had everything set up, we popped some popcorn and got snacks. Finally, we told our daughter and she was super excited. She ran out to the yard and her face lit up as we all gathered around and watched Secret Life of Pets 2. It was an amazing night and I'm so glad I did it.","I always had a fun childhood.

61,Hippocorpus,"About two months ago, I began working at my practicum placement for my graduate school practicum requirement. During this time, I have gotten to know my practicum supervisor and have had the opportunity to learn a lot about the students who attend the school. In particular, I have gotten to know the Kindergarteners and first graders very well. There is one particular kindergartener, a blonde-haired little boy with none of his front teeth and a long braid down his back, that I have come to enjoy seeing around school. About two weeks ago, he came up to me and was crying. He grabbed me in an embrace and told me how much he wanted ""Picture Day"" to last all day. His mother had dressed him up and styled his braid with extra care that morning. He clearly was very excited about how nice he looked but was having a hard morning. He looked very precious and it put a smile on my face. He shared with me that he was feeling sad and really needed a friend that morning. We got him his breakfast and made our way into my office. After opening up his chocolate milk and juice cartons, he started to cry and leaned his head against the wall. He doubted that he could make it through the whole day without getting his picture taken at least twice. I felt sad to see him so upset. He jumped up from his chair and hugged me around my waist, still crying. I talked to him about how hard school can be and how brave he was. He told me that he felt better. The other day, he picked up his school pictures and I found a portrait signed by him sitting on my desk. It made me feel very happy and loved by this little boy I had come to know so well.","About two months ago, I began working at my practicum placement for my graduate school practicum requirement.

62,Hippocorpus,"I was driving in a wealthy Southern California town when my back right tire blew out. I had just attended a lecture at the time, and I found the content extremely emotionally draining, so I wasn't in an excellent mood to begin with. The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled ""no stopping any time."" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. A woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, ""The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME."" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. An older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me. My stomach dropped with dread. While I am generally not a cruel person and welcome interactions with people in unfortunate situations, being stuck as I was in ninety degree heat with drivers around me shouting angrily and honking, I wasn't in the most convenient position to help anyone. I didn't have any cash with me to give him, and I didn't know if I could handle a heart-wrenching conversation about how horrendous life can be or learning about the man's visions from God, if he had them. It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. My anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car. I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire. There were tears in my eyes when I thanked him. We talked for a little while; he'd been a teacher once. He didn't go into specifics about his current situation. I offered to take him to dinner, but he refused. He told me to drive safely, and then he walked away. I'm convinced this man was some kind of guardian angel. I'm so grateful to him.","I was driving in a wealthy Southern California town when my back right tire blew out.

63,Hippocorpus,"One night in June, I went to the gym to burn off some excess energy and clear my head so I'd fall asleep more easily. I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. She tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why; I briefly considered walking away from the situation. The anger welled up in me and I knew I had to give her a piece of my mind about what had become a disturbing habit of alcohol abuse. I raised my voice and told her it didn't matter how my day was, because she ruined it by getting excessively intoxicated when she knew it was something that greatly upset. She looked at me with an expression of confusion and sloppily said she was sorry. I yelled at her that she wasn't sorry because she kept behaving that way even though she knew how much it upset me, and it was better not to lie. I told her she was a selfish person and she had a problem, and if she was going to be a liar, she should learn to do a better job of it or just not talk to me at all. I grabbed my laptop and stormed out of the room, exiting to my bedroom. I went into my adjoining bathroom, slamming the door open so hard that it knocked the towel rack through the drywall. I looked at my angry face in the mirror and wondered why I allowed such a pathetic person to upset me so greatly. She wasn't worth it.","One night in June, I went to the gym to burn off some excess energy and clear my head so I'd fall asleep more easily.

I thought it would be a responsible thing to do. I decided to run a full credit report on myself as I have never done one before. I never understood why my credit score was so low. I have always made payments on time, never kept a balance, and barely used my cards. When I saw the results, I was shocked. I had two credit cards that were basically maxed out that I never knew about. I called the company that said I had accounts there and they said payments were being made on them so it doesn't seem to be fraud and I should ask people I know. So, it turns out my own parent had falsely opened the cards under my name. I had 12,000 in credit card debt because of that associated with my name. And this is on top of my student loans! I was so upset and hurt by this. I forced her to find a way to pay it back and get it off my name. Eventually she did. I am still hurt and weary of it all.","A few months ago I was trying to get on top of my financial situation. I am three years out of school now with student loans to be repaid.

65,Hippocorpus,"Earlier this summer, my neighbor---who I have known my entire life of 34 years---suddenly passed away. At first, I was very shocked. I had just sat down with her around my birthday, and while she mentioned having back pain, she was still sharp as a knife and not sick. I have lived in this house forever (as I inherited it from my parents when they passed away, back when I was in college). I grew up knowing this neighbor. I viewed her as part of my extended family. She would always walk her adorable Yorkie dog down the street, and if I were outside, she would stop to talk to me about the day. When I learned of her passing, I decided to attend her funeral. Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six. He cared a lot for our neighbor, too, but he is so young he doesn't quite understand the concept of mortality yet. I didn't want to expose him to her if her casket was open. (It was.)At the funeral, I talked to other neighbors who were equally upset and sad. I hugged her family. I watched a slideshow of photos that also showed her husband, who had passed away earlier. I liked him, too. Now her children are planning to sell her house, and I'm a little nervous. I've never had a new neighbor so close before.","Earlier this summer, my neighbor---who I have known my entire life of 34 years---suddenly passed away. At first, I was very shocked. I had just sat down with her around my birthday, and while she mentioned having back pain, she was still sharp as a knife and not sick. <br><br>I have lived in this house forever (as I inherited it from my parents when they passed away, back when I was in college). I grew up knowing this neighbor. I viewed her as part of my extended family. She would always walk her adorable Yorkie dog down the street, and if I were outside, she would stop to talk to me about the day. <br><br>When I learned of her passing, I decided to attend her funeral. Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six. He cared a lot for our neighbor, too, but he is so young he doesn't quite understand the concept of mortality yet. I didn't want to expose him to her if her casket was open. (It was.)<br><br>At the funeral, I talked to other neighbors who were equally upset and sad. I hugged her family. I watched a slideshow of photos that also showed her husband, who had passed away earlier. I liked him, too. <br><br>Now her children are planning to sell her house, and I'm a little nervous. I've never had a new neighbor so close before.",,"[0.013181888, 0.072951235, 0.005371918, 0.015443176, -0.0036110668, -0.012579505, -0.032908805, 0.0070353257, 0.0032113972, 0.011114366, -0.06988877,

66,Hippocorpus,"In August of this year, I went with my wife and our kids, along with my father in law and my sister in law and her family to spread the ashes of my mother in law. We hiked up a trail in the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction Colorado, to one of her favorite spots to visit. It took about half an hour to get there. It was my first time going, but my wife and kids had gone before when my mother in law was not sick. When we got to the spot, a large cliff overlooking the area, we took a few minutes to look around and enjoy the scenery. Then we found a small juniper tree that sat near the edge, and my father in law spread the ashes around the base. My kids hung up some trinkets they had brought that reminded them of their grandma, and everyone had brought a stone from her collection to stack on the spot. After we had done this, my father in law sat down and started crying. It was hard to watch, as he had never displayed that kind of emotion around me before. My older daughter sat down next to him and they just sat there for a while and looked out on the valley ahead of them. She was the most in tune with her grandfather of all the grandchildren. She was the oldest, and had recently spent several months living with her grandparents, and had really grown to be close with them. After they had sat for a while and came to terms with the moment, we went to one of my mother in law's favorite mexican restaurants to have dinner. We all talked about the memories we had of her, and her personality traits that stood out. My wife had a peach margarita in her honor, as that was one of her favorite drinks.","In August of this year, I went with my wife and our kids, along with my father in law and my sister in law and her family to spread the ashes of my mother in law.

67,Hippocorpus,"This happened about 3 months ago. I was driving with my brother back from the movie theater when we were sideswiped by another car. It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying. It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures. We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop. We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were. We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay. The other driver got out of their car and was obviously under the influence. You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away. My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought. The other driver looked to be in his mid 20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police. The police got there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed miserably. I exchanged information with one of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come. The other driver was arrested and my car was towed away. It is the only major accident I've ever been in besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots. Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay. It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for. I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other driver, but his insurance settled out with us. Ironically, my car was salvaged out about a month later due to hail damage (somehow that was more costly than this accident).","This happened about 3 months ago.

69,Hippocorpus,I work at a corporate IT department where we handle repairs and respond to high-level client issues. Recently I was able to fix an urgent problem for a client very quickly. Basically saving the company millions of dollars and reputation. Because of this my bosses decided to thank me and promote me at our monthly IT meeting. In front of everyone of course. It was actually pretty awesome. I was excited that I was able to do my job well. It's not often I get this kind of praise in front of a crowd of 100+ people(co-workers). So it's definitely a moment I will remember for a long time. Really burns a fire to work hard and keep a dedicated grind! My immediate boss gave me a small award as well. Once I got back to the office we had pizza and food all ready for the team. I was amazed the company did all this. How often does corporate do this kind of stuff? I would say very rarely so I was pleased.,I work at a corporate IT department where we handle repairs and respond to high-level client issues.

70,Hippocorpus,"There are some memorable days in my life and they remain ever green in my heart. My first day of school is such a day. It was the month of January 2003. I was then only six years old. My father proposed that i should be admitted into a school in class on the next day. I felt very excited I could not think of anything else. I was always thinking about the school, the teachers, as I watched on TV. I could not even sleep well that night. The next morning my mother woke me early in the morning, she washed me very well, combed my hair and dressed me in new clothes. Then I had breakfast and started for school with my father. He took me to the nearest CFB primary school at 9:30 am. The school was not very far from our home, so we walked all the way. It took us about 30 minutes to get to the school. When I stepped into the school compound with my father I was somewhat afraid. I saw many students on the school campus, some were playing, some were talking to each other. Finding myself in a new environment my heart started to beat, at first my father took me to the headmaster's room and requested him to admit me in first grade, I was nervous but his smiling face and and gentle eyes put me to ease. He asked me my name and I answered him. then he pointed me to a letter chart and asked me to say some letters. I could say them all because my mother taught me how to say it at home. Then he became very pleased at me and admitted me to first grade, then he called Ms. Fatema the first grade teacher to take me to class. When I entered the class all the students in the class where staring at me, I felt a bit nervous once again to see the new faces, I sat down and at my leisure period, all my classmates started playing in the field. I felt very lonely and was loitering here and there, then they invited me to join them. I started playing. I felt myself like a free bird flying in the open sky. My school ends at 12pm, my mother was at the gate to receive me. I leapt into her arms. She kissed me and caught me in her arms. That was how I spent my first day of school. I left the school with a new experience and a cheerful mind. I shall never forget that day as long as I live.","There are some memorable days in my life and they remain ever green in my heart.

71,Hippocorpus,"Exactly three months ago today, I had the worst experience of my life. I could not eat without vomiting. I could not sleep for the pain. I was in desperate need of a doctor but didn't have health insurance. I waited as long as I could and finally when my eyes began turning yellow and my skin a yellowish orange color, I decided it was time to go to the emergency room. I was concerned of how I would pay for a visit but I knew something was wrong. It was almost like I could feel death approaching me. When I came into the emergency department, I was immediately triaged and when the doctor examined me, his first words to the nurse was, ""Book an OR, stat!"". That was scary but at that point I was a the mercy of the physicians. I prayed to God, asking for his protection. Ten minutes later, I was under anesthesia, grasping at life. The initial surgery took 2 hours and the second surgery took 11 hours. In recovery, the doctor explained to me that I had to be opened up and fixed. My gallbladder had gall stones and those gall stones had acted like bullets inside my body when my gallbladder had burst open. The gallstones tore through my pancreas, liver, and right kidney. They had to go in and do some repairs. While the ordeal was traumatic and scary, it is a constant reminder that in a blink of an eye, I could have been 6 feet under right now. I am thankful I went to the hospital when I did. I am still unsure how to pay for the $800,000 bill, but I suppose that is the cost of my life. Today I am a healthy 39 year old female who has an incredible deep red and ugly abdominal scar, but has the hope of a future.","Exactly three months ago today, I had the worst experience of my life.

72,Hippocorpus,"Within this year I have gone back to college to get my degree in science. For years I have not gone to college because of my physical and mental health but decided to try because I have always wanted to complete college. It was hard. My skin condition made it painful to sleep let alone study and attend class. I sprained my ankle, got the flu and almost quit but I kept going despite having every excuse not to. Then by the end of the semester I was given a ''fun'' assignment by our Psychology professor to do something that would make us feel uncomfortable and write how we overcame that. At the same time I had to give a Ted Talk style speech in my Writing and Research class so this was a great opportunity to do both. I felt uncomfortable and I even regretted it at first but I was able to complete both of my assignments and ended up getting a B+ for each of those classes while getting As for my Math and History class. This was a roller coaster of emotions but I'm glad I did it. Now I'm stronger to continue on to my next semester which is just one week away. I was surprised at myself. I quit college 3 times the first semester before this so I was afraid I would have to pay for it all again. But it was worth it. Now I'm a step closer to my goal and I feel that I'm not just learning the subject of each class. I'm learning how to take notes better and how to approach real life problems with the tools I've learned in Psychology.","Within this year I have gone back to college to get my degree in science.

One night after we spent time talking like we did, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I asked him if he was formally asking and not just joking. He said he was. I said yes. Not even two weeks later he broke up with me. Because we both had other things to take care of. There was suddenly no room for me in his life. I'm still broken up about it. I still hurt. It hurts right now. Why promise me these things and then take them away? What did I do. Did I do wrong? He says I didn't. I don't believe him. I don't hate him.","He told me that he'd wait for me.

74,Hippocorpus,"My wife has been trying to convince me to start streaming on Twitch and I finally took the plunge a few months ago. Just this week out of nowhere I got a ton of new follows and went from being a small nobody stream to a not too small not quite a nobody stream with a couple hundred follows and an eighty viewer average. It was at this moment that I realized that maybe I actually could make streaming into something. Apparently people like to watch me once they discover me and find my brand of humor amusing. My wife is currently my only moderator but this also means she's watching my streams when I'm playing and we've grown closer because of the sheer amount of stupid twitch chat/streaming involves. Last weekend I got a donation from someone that touched me. In it they talked about how they'd been going through a rough time of their lives because their parents had gotten in a car wreck while they were on vacation. They had both lived but their father had gotten paralyzed. He'd been depressed since the accident since he'd always been an active man but now couldn't do that anymore. His father asked him what he was watching and he showed him the stream and they wound up watching me for the entire three hours I was streaming that night. His father's mood apparently improved and he even asked when the next time I'd be streaming is and asked his son if they could watch me together again. I'd never thought that doing something as silly as playing video-games and just talking with random people in my chat could help. I'm glad to find out I was mistaken though and even if it's just a guy and his father I'm happy to say it at least helped two people. My wife however is living the ""I told you so"" dream at this point and keeps rubbing in that I should have started sooner. Now if only my father was still around so I could join the ""I told you so"" bandwagon since he always said ""You can't make money playing video-games"".","My wife has been trying to convince me to start streaming on Twitch and I finally took the plunge a few months ago.

75,Hippocorpus,"This event happened about two months back. I work from home so my home computer is my life line. Without it I simply couldn't get paid. Anyway two months ago my CPU suddenly just died. At first I had no idea what had went wrong, but apparently the cooling gel used to keep the CPU under extreme temps had mostly evaporated, so the CPU was overheating during my late night gaming sessions. At the point in time I didn't have enough money to buy a better CPU, I had just finished paying off a bunch of debt that I collected over the years. I pretty much thought I was screwed and maybe had to go out and get a temp job until I had enough money to replace my broken CPU. Anyway I had told my mom about it and I guess she told the family because a few days later my mom came over and handed me an envelope of money. At first I thought it was from her and I declined it, I didn't want to take my mother's hard earned money she got from working all those years. But she informed me a few of my brothers and sisters got together and pooled in money, enough that I could replace my CPU with a brand new powerful one. I'm not much of an emotional guy, at least in front of others. I try to always keep my cool and play it straight, but I couldn't help as the tears started to fall from my eyes. I was so grateful and thankful that people who loved and cared for me came through and went the extra mile for this. My family isn't rich, so I know them giving up their hard earned money to help me out was big. Not saying we're poor, but we're not rich enough where we can just give away money without a care in the world. My mom gave me a big hug and in that moment I felt the deepest amount of gratitude I ever experienced in my entire life. From the bottom of my heart I was truly deeply thankful. Later on I got together with my brothers and sisters that helped out, throwing them a party in their honor. It was the least I could do for such wonderful family members.","This event happened about two months back. I work from home so my home computer is my life line.

76,Hippocorpus,"I recently went on a swimming trip with a group of friends. It was after a Sunday religious service we are all a part of on a hot summer day. We all arranged together how we would get there and where we were going. We drove in three separate cars. We arrived at an area of a river where there was a canal that had deep and slow moving water. It was a short walk to the area, and we had to climb down a rocky ledge to reach it. I decided to go in fast while the others were tentative because of the cold water. When getting in, I scraped my arm on the rock I was holding while lowering myself. It made me feel rather clumsy and then I started worrying about if it might get infected. I didn't make a big deal of it because I didn't want to ruin anyone else's time. We all swam for a little while, then gathered in a shallow area and just sat and talked for a while. At one point I decided to get up and explore some of the rocky area around the swimming hole. Being with the group was reminding me of times as a kid when I went swimming in these kinds of places with friends. It was making me sad that I don't do it that often anymore. So I felt that going off on my own and gathering my emotions would be best. I walked around on the rocks and looked at the trees of the forest behind it. Then I found a spot in the shade and laid down for the remainder of our time there. A friend yelled up to me that we were leaving so then we all climbed back up the ledge and got in the cars and left.","I recently went on a swimming trip with a group of friends.

Apparently, she was walking into the kitchen when she saw her going in circles and then lay down. She rushed her to the vet. She kept repeating that the poor baby just wasn't there anymore and she hoped she made the right choice. I got angry. Of course she didn't make the right choice! How could she not try to go to the specialist! Why wouldn't she let me take her? I can't believe I didn't even get to say goodbye one last time. My girl wasn't supposed to go yet. I am so mad that I didn't take her on that walk when I last visited. She always loved walks and I was too selfish to spare the 15 minutes. That was always her favorite.","Today was a horrible day.

78,Hippocorpus,"Well, I am a grandmother. I have a 30 year old son. He got married at 17, and I have an 11 year old granddaughter and a 2 year old grandson. My son's dad was Jewish, from Poland, but born in New York in 1966. He died of a brain tumor. My son looks fine, but the kids were born with a brain cyst. Both had had a brain surgery to help them, but the cysts are still there. These cysts are affecting their lives. They have to go see the Doctor and check them. Just a week ago, my little grandson had a surgery again. I went to visit him in the Hospital, and he looked so delicate, so blue, and very, very pale. I am so worried about them, but other than that, when the cysts are not acting, they are healthy, normal, and very intelligent. I would say that they are geniuses. And happy. I just love them. They don't live with me, but they come visit. I love to play with my grandson. He is the one that plays with me. Last night, we were playing, and I showed him a chess box. We placed all the pieces in the board and we had fun with them. I am so happy he is doing well. He has to wear a helmet because his skull is so thin that one fall could be fatal. But in the last check up, the Dr. said his skull is getting better. Perhaps one day he will be able to be without the helmet. Right now, just seeing them alive is a miracle.","Well, I am a grandmother. I have a 30 year old son. He got married at 17, and I have an 11 year old granddaughter and a 2 year old grandson.

Last night, we were playing, and I showed him a chess box. We placed all the pieces in the board and we had fun with them. <br><br>I am so happy he is doing well. He has to wear a helmet because his skull is so thin that one fall could be fatal. But in the last check up, the Dr. said his skull is getting better. Perhaps one day he will be able to be without the helmet. <br><br>Right now, just seeing them alive is a miracle.",,"[-0.0045644105, -0.010981286, -0.012498535, 0.019266224, 0.027095849, 0.0062398463,

79,Hippocorpus,"After my son was born in 2016, I lived with my parents for a couple years. I got married and my husband moved in with us, and we decided to have another baby in January of 2018. During that time, my Dad was diagnosed with early signs of dementia. It was a hard time for all of us. He was mostly bed ridden and having other complications as well. He survived skin cancer 2 different times and was missing part of his nose and mouth from it. He started to be very mean to my son at random times because of the dementia and it got very tough and stressful. We were ALL on edge about it. My husband who lived with us as well, decided that we were moving out because of it. When we told them the news, everyone got into an argument and it got VERY heated. It was mostly my husband that made the decision, so my parents took all the anger out on him. We moved out. And I was in very little to no contact with them. During that time, my Dad passed away from a heart attack. I would give anything to go back in time and tell him that I love him.","After my son was born in 2016, I lived with my parents for a couple years.

80,Hippocorpus,"Today I went to meet another newborn. With flowers for mom and gift for baby in hand, I made my way through the hospital hallways, recalling the memories of the birth of my own baby, my now two year old and husband walking alongside me. In the past few months, the baby fever has overwhelmed me, made me giddy with excitement, and brought me to tears. After a very difficult and traumatic labor and delivery two years back, I never thought I would want another one so soon. But here I was walking in the hallways, past the nursery, the faint echo of brand-new baby cries lingering into my heart. It seemed like everyone near and dear to me was either pregnant, or just had a brand new baby, something I long for so bad. But I know, realistically, right now would not be the ideal time for cradles and bibs. That time, I know, is so close, but seemingly so far away. There are things that must be done to prepare; the unchecked list runs through my head every single day. My body needs to be 20-30 pounds lighter. We need to figure out a few financial things. I need to get my dentist work done first. I need to read all the books and do all the research. My husband, also with his own worries and fears, needs to be on the same page. Somehow my many ""needs"" have put my one major ""want"" on hold, and it's resulted in a sin called envy. I greet another tired mama, stare at another sweet sleeping babe, and hand in hand with my husband, walk out the door. We get into the car, and I let out a heavy, longing sigh. My husband, looks me straight in the eyes. ""What?"" I ask. He doesn't speak, just gives me a small smile. We speak to each other without speaking. I smile back as tears fall down my cheeks. I close my eyes and the list appears. Check. My heart is content.","Today I went to meet another newborn.

81,Hippocorpus,"I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option. I had found extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it. I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit. Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom. After I actually did this I felt empowered but by the next day I felt terrified because I had devoted 7 1/2 years to a job I had retired from. I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over. I had taken the kids to school and it was time for me to get online and work. This was almost 3 weeks ago. It has been a struggle so far and I'm learning how to navigate my time when it comes to working online, but it's been rewarding. This destination of happiness, while I realized it's a mood and not so much a destination, I have spent much more time feeling it. I've not only been able to take my kids to school, but I've actually been able to watch my 14 year old son's soccer games and haven't missed a baseball practice for my younger son and we've spent more time hiking and going to the dog park. I know it won't be easy but I am tired of living on auto pilot. For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling. I hope to find more work online because I need more income soon, but I feel as though things will work out for the best. Sometimes you have to choose yourself and actually live. This was my time and I'm proud to say I chose me.","I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option.

82,Hippocorpus,"It was three months ago that my dog ended up missing. My husband and I looked everywhere. We walked up and down many streets. Drove to different neighborhoods. But no sign of Peanut. It was horrible and distressing. Our daughter was so sad that, she couldn't even function in school. This affected all of us very deeply. Peanut was our bestfriend of 10 years. Then one day our daughter came home and told me that she had seen Peanut in a yard near her school. So we went there, and sure enough it was Peanut. He yelped and jumped up and down, he was so glad to see us. We knocked on the door of the mobile home. A man answered the door. The man there said he had dog for years. He told us to leave the property or he was going to call the police. I said good, I hope you call them. When the police arrived, one officer talked to us and the other talked to the man. I showed the officer pictures of Peanut on my phone, the ad I had posted in the lost and found in the local newspaper, and the flyers that I have printed and posted all over town. Both the officers talked among themselves. Then they talked to us. They said since the man doesn't have any proof of a vet bill, no pictures, no anything to prove otherwise, they said take your dog home and make sure he can't get loose again. I was happy with tears and my daughter was so happy, because the whole time Peanut was so excited to see us. It was obvious he was our dog.","It was three months ago that my dog ended up missing.

83,Hippocorpus,"This has been one of the hardest days of my life. I lost my little friend, Prance. I should start by saying that Prance was a rescue dog. Prance came from a local shelter. Prance was 3 years old when I got him. The day, April 17, that I got Prance was exactly a year to the day that I had lost another dog, Butch. Like Butch, Prance was a Schnauzer. I woke up that morning and just had a strong desire to go to the animal shelter. And there was Prance. From the first moment, we bonded, and he was like my little grey shadow. April 17th 2019, I treated the day like it was Prance's birthday, since his actual birth date was unknown. He had turned 12. Prance had always been a very picky eater and he had started refusing his food. On the 4th day of not eating, I took Prance to the vet. Prance had pancreatitis and had to be hospitalized. When Prance came home, he was refusing to eat again. Prance began to get very weak and had difficulty standing up. He was now at a point where he could not walk at all. Prance was laying next to me, as he always was, while I watched TV. Prance suddenly reached out his paw to me 3 times, like he would do when he wanted to get some attention. I picked Prance up and held him. Prance began to tremble and shake. He took a couple of deep breathes and went limp in my arms. I feel like Prance reached out to me to say goodbye, and I am happy that I was there for him in his last moment of life.","This has been one of the hardest days of my life.

84,Hippocorpus," About two weeks ago, my boyfriend's grandmother passed away. Her critical health condition did not surprise anyone as her health had been declining for months. On top of that she had dementia from mid stage Alzheimer's so she really didn't remember much of anything. The day she was admitted to the hospital she collapsed in her room at the nursing home. They rushed her to the hospital. The doctors said that she shattered the bone in her shoulder. They needed to operate on her. However, they knew that she probably wouldn't survive the surgery due to her fragile condition. They told us that she probably wouldn't live much longer. We should expect the worst. They fed her a steady supply of pain medications while we watched unable to do anything. My boyfriend, his family, and myself returned home to think about what happened. At four in the morning they called us to inform us that her heartbeat was getting fainter. We should return to the hospital if we wanted to say goodbye. So we all left gathering around her. As we said our goodbyes, she passed away. We all stood around crying. My boyfriend's uncle would be arriving shortly to check up on us. We went home afterwards and sat in silence. I found the whole thing depressing. Everyone else seemed to take it better than me. They told me that the person they knew and loved died a long time ago. She would continue to decline due to her dementia. At least she was able to pass before she progressed into late stage Alzheimer's. Regardless, it impacted me. My boyfriend hugged me as his mother cooked breakfast."," About two weeks ago, my boyfriend's grandmother passed away.

85,Hippocorpus,"It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult. I NEVER would have seen this coming when I was just an innocent kid who used to go Down South each summer and stay with her over other nearby relatives because she was so kind to me. Although it's been decades, I remember her taking me to the movies, amusement parks and our annual family reunion barbecue. This was before her child was born, so it was just me and her for the most part when we weren't out and about. Those were the days -- miss 'em indeed. Now her child is grown and she looks like an anorexic, bug-eyed, stressed-out version of her old dour, well-fed self. She has literally lost dozens of pounds and is so skinny, the entire family is afraid severe weight loss will end her before any other medical problem can. I first found out about the cult she joined from relatives who, unlike me, talk to her fairly regularly. We went to see her in person this summer because of increasing concerns about her state of mind, and were we in for a shock. Her formerly well-kept home, which she has owned for years, was a complete mess, like a hurricane flew through it several times over. SHE was a complete mess, too. It was so sad to see her but not recognize the random ramblings about her new group of ""friends."" Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of them, so there were no confrontations with the people dragging her down. Our only hope is that eventually we will be able to stage a successful intervention to help her reclaim her life. I hope and wish with all my heart that we will not be too late.","It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult.

86,Hippocorpus,"I decided to quit my job. It was a decision I debated and sat on for a while to be honest. I had been thinking about it so much and had been waiting for the right sign and when I finally got it, I just kind of acted on impulse. I went home that night and decided to just never return. Now, yes, I hated my job, but like everyone else in America I was there because I kind of needed it. But what was the value in that? What was I worth to myself? Willingly signing up to deal with bullshit and be stressed out every single day was affecting who exactly the most? And to make matters worse, I found out they were stealing money from me after I was practically their best employee. So yeah, I had to quit. It was pretty much the only choice I was left with. Things have not always been the best since I have quit either. Please do not get me wrong. I often wonder if doing that was the smartest possible choice I could make. But I can always find solace in the fact that I take care of myself first. And knowing that is all I need to sleep like a baby at night.","I decided to quit my job.

87,Hippocorpus,"This has been an extremely exhausting last few months, emotionally. My mother, who has always suffered with anxiety and depression, was admitted into a psychiatric ward in May after a particularly difficult bout of depression. We found out she was not taking her medicine. She had entered into a psychotic state and it ended up taking 5 weeks before she could be released. She changed hospitals twice. I do not live where my mother does so I had to take time off work and spend a lot of time traveling. It was unbelievably exhausting. I did, however, develop a lot of friendships with her caretakers. In the end she made huge progress, thankfully. However we are all concerned the issue will return. She is home now and doing ok but she may never be the same. Now she is doing group therapy weekly. Additionally she is back on meds that should work. I am back to work now and do not visit as much. I used to feel guilty but at this point I am beyond tired.","This has been an extremely exhausting last few months, emotionally.

88,Hippocorpus,"Today was a very good Sunday. I was invited to lead the music at a joint church service at a church I've never been to before. A church in a city a bit far off, they asked if I could lead their music. I was floored by the invitation. The pastor of that asked for me specifically. He had visited my church a couple of times before and saw how we run our music for our liturgy. As the leader of my church's music, I only expected to lead music for my church. I never really had thoughts of leading other churches in the near future. Then a couple weeks before this day, my pastor told me that the pastor of another church we will be joining services with asked me to lead their music for our joint service. I was initially in shock, but jumped at the chance to serve where I was able. After I finished leading music at the church, I felt great and more sure of my abilities. The church members were very thankful for my services and enjoyed the all a'cappella approach I institute at my own church. They told me how they enjoyed just hearing voices to sing hymns and how much more participation the congregation there was than before. I am very grateful for the opportunity I was given and how blessed myself and others were in the service I was able to give. I hope I get opportunities like this again, but to remember that it is all for the glory of God and not myself.","Today was a very good Sunday.

89,Hippocorpus,"On July 9, 2019 I moving in with my Celia. This is kinda weird, because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/ accessories. Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally. It is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity. I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it. Their contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible. The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice. It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone. It is midday and it is hot up here. That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room. The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her. Just energy of joy is bounding through my body. Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away. Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing. It was great though, because it was her way of going out of her way to make this a great first day. Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into. Finding a good groove to sit in felt like I was making a long term investment. While she laid under my arm it placed over her like a puzzle piece fitting in. It feels like the right decision and that this is going to be a positive experience no matter how it ends.","On July 9, 2019 I moving in with my Celia.

90,Hippocorpus,I got up early that morning and took a shower then got dressed. I proceeded to go into the kitchen made my lunch then fed my cats and off I went to the office. Traffic was very bad that morning stop and go. As I sat in traffic I got so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. The longer I stayed in traffic the worse I felt. I couldn't keep my eyes open. I finally got a block from my office and came to a stop light and don't remember going through the red light and hitting another car. After I hit the car of course my air bag went off and knocked the air out of me leaving me having a hard time breathing. I then heard the sound of an ambulance approaching. Two medics got out and tried to get me out of my car but the couldn't because my leg was badly messed up and bleeding. Needless to say I broke my ankle and had to have pins put in it plus a compound fracture of my leg and all my ribs on my right side broken. I stayed in the hospital for about two weeks and had a lot of physical therapy. This happened about six months ago and I am still having a little trouble walking but little by little I'm getting better. The accident was indeed my fault. I'm so glad the other person did not have any injuries. I since learned I have sleep- apnea and that is why I fell asleep at the wheel. I worry about driving and at times I'm very nervous but with time I know things will get better. I had to drive with my son to get the courage to drive again and even then I was very nervous and shaky . You never know what will happen when you leave home to go to work so always try to be prepared.,I got up early that morning and took a shower then got dressed.

91,Hippocorpus,"I've been struggling a bit lately financially. I'm not making the same money I was making at my job, and things are really tight for me right now. I had a flat tire on my car, and I changed it and put the donut tire on. I can't afford to buy a new tire right now. The donut tire has a slow leak though, and I was always putting air in it. The whole situation just has me down and depressed. I work with a good friend of mine. We are close and have been friends for a long time. She knows I have been struggling with things. She asked me one day if she could use my car on her lunch break to run a couple errands. Her husband had dropped her off that day because her car was getting an oil change. I told her sure and gave her the keys. She came back to work after her lunch and gave me my keys and we went about our day. I left work that day and went out to my car. Something was different on it, and it took me a minute to realize that my donut tire was gone, and there was a brand new tire on my car. I stood there dumbfounded thinking ""how did this happen?"" and I called my friend and asked her if she knew anything about. She laughed, and told me ""Happy Birthday"" that she had bought me a new tire for my car for my Birthday that was coming. I was so surprised and touched, that I burst into tears.

92,Hippocorpus,"Leah, my 4 year old, began pre-school. I was already a nervous wreck, because she and I had to get up early to go see my oldest daughter do her ""Senior Walk"", where all of the seniors walk into school on the first day behind their principal and all of us parents are on the sides cheering and yelling and crying and it is over in 5 minutes. I was worried about Leah having to get up early and us driving to the high school, finding a parking spot and then getting back to her school and having her into her classroom on time. We had no problem getting back to her school in time. My plan was to park and walk my little girl to her class, but on the car ride over, she declared that she wanted to be dropped off and walk into the school by herself, because she was a big girl. I was sad. When we got to her school, and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs and they walked her into the building. I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. She is my miracle baby and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been her and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house and I miss her. I miss having her eat lunch with me and I walked into the mall without her and felt like someone was going to ask me for id when I walked into the kids section of a store. I didn't get begged to go into Build a Bear or get a Frappucino from Starbucks and have to wait for her to jump on all of the squares in the tile flooring. She is adjusting well to her new school schedule and I have time to watch stupid shows like 90 Day Fiance. I guess I will make it. I am scared, but she thinks she is ready, and that is more of what matters.","Leah, my 4 year old, began pre-school.

And I finally got a chance to use it. When I first put it on, I was blown away by how it looked. I felt like this was the future. I completely lost myself in the game I was playing, and for a while, I even forgot I was standing in my living room. This was so much fun. I had a blast, and I couldn't wait to tell others about it. I invited over my friends to try for themselves as well. They were a bit skeptical but once they put the VR headset on, they were blown away just like I was. In the end it was a great experience and I will never forget it. Even my family came over to try it. They also enjoyed it. One of my friends even went out to buy himself one. All in all, they really loved it.","This experience happened when I got something I've been wanting to try my entire life. A VR headset.

94,Hippocorpus,"On August 19, 2019, I went to see my new neurologist concerning my MS. I have had MS for many years but over the last 10 years or so, I moved from relapsing remitting to secondary progressive. I have been having a lot of problems with falling and stumbling and the fatigue has been horrible. To further complicate the issue I fell on April 2nd this year and tore up my knee, which exacerbated the MS. I started back to work the first day of school, August 14th. I substitute in high needs SPED. I knew I wasn't doing well with my MS, but it came as a complete shock to me when my doctor told me I was ""running out of reserves/ basically about out of reserves"" and I need to conserve my energy NOW. She said I should not be working. I love my students, so she understood why I continued. Now, I am having to cut back my days at school and have accepted the fact that this year will be last year of teaching. I want to use my energy for doing the other things I love, which is traveling. I am going to Italy in September and will have to go on a rollator/wheelchair. I am devastated. I have been bursting into tears, even at school. I am having problems coping with this new news. It's almost like when I was first diagnosed, but worse now because of my age. I have always ""pushed through"" and tried to exercise my legs. I have been told I should really STOP now to reserve whatever I have left. I am using my walker at home now, so that is helping with my falling. However, because I used to be paralyzed from my waist down and spent years on my scooter, I do not want to have to use a scooter again. I donated both of mine. I also had hand controls in my vehicle, which I am afraid I might have to do again. I am okay with that aid. I simply feel like I am going backwards, even though I have known for the 34 years I've had MS it is a progressive disease. Now that my husband is retired and we can do things, it is so difficult for me, though I thoroughly enjoy travelling. This new news about my MS has been emotionally and mentally exhausting.","On August 19, 2019, I went to see my new neurologist concerning my MS.

95,Hippocorpus,"I'm from Tampa, Florida, but this past Summer, I decided to call Nantucket Island home. It's an entire 2600 miles away and I've, quite literally, never moved out of the state of Florida even though I've traveled plenty. Even though I'm thirty three years old, it doesn't stop my parents from worrying and missing me every day. It just so happens that this year my Mother was turning fifty back in June. I made the arrangements to fly home and throw her a surprise party with my sister-in-law. It was a whirlwind trip but it was definitely worth it! My Mom isn't much for being the center of attention or professing her emotions beyond what is necessary. In fact, it is quite possible I've seen my Dad cry more than I have seen her cry. That is saying a lot! At her birthday party, she was clearly very surprised when she arrived. There were easily a hundred people in attendance. The greatest moment of all, though, was when her eyes finally landed on me. She started CRYING and then she started laughing and then she cried some more. Her legs just about gave out from underneath her. To make things even better, it was all caught on tape! I will never, for the rest of my life, forget that moment. It is one of my very favorite memories.","I'm from Tampa, Florida, but this past Summer, I decided to call Nantucket Island home.

96,Hippocorpus,"My husband and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary. It is emotional for me, because we've been together for eleven years so celebrating an anniversary with someone I love so much makes me happy. A lot of people don't last in relationships, and to have a long lasting relationship and a great one makes me very happy. My husband surprised me on our anniversary by taking me to the resort that we got married at. It was a very special seafood dinner buffet. It was fancy, and when we go out to eat we usually don't eat out at places so fancy, so it was very special. I have cherished the time I spent with my husband. We have gone on lots of fun trips together. We have moved cross country twice. My relationship is a very memorable part of my life. It feels very special to get to spend my life with someone. The most memorable part of this year as well is that my English Bulldog celebrated one year of not having pneumonia. She was very sick a year ago and almost died. She is very important to me and my husband. She makes us both very happy, and adds to the joy of our relationship.","My husband and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary.

97,Hippocorpus,"Two months ago my partner and I went on vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada. The beginning was rough as we had two to three hours delay with our flight. I was supposed to arrive at 8:00 pm local time but ended up reaching there around 10:30 pm. We had problems with our transportation to our hotel. There was a misunderstanding with the driver, who took us to the wrong hotel. Finally, at 11:15 pm we reached our hotel. We were tired so we could do nothing except go to bed. However, next morning we were amazed by the layout of casinos in the hotel; there were hundreds. After having breakfast, we set out to observe the sin city. There were people everywhere. We were thrilled to see amazing structures such the water show at one of the hotels. We walked all day observing hotels and casinos and trying out various drinks. The night time was even more amazing with music and songs being played. There was a memorable volcanic eruption show at a hotel next to ours. The next day we took a tour bus and traveled to various parts of the city. It was very exhilarating. We had a great time in Las Vegas and will cherish it for a long time.","Two months ago my partner and I went on vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada.

98,Hippocorpus," About two weeks ago I adopted a new cat. I go to a local pet store once a week or once every two weeks to buy supplies for my animals. I often take my husband to the pet store with me so that he can carry the heavier items that I purchase. At the back of the pet store there is a small room that has a big window so people can see in. Inside the room are several cages where cats are kept that are available for adoption. Several months ago, my husband noticed an orange cat with the name Ivan in one of the cages and he seemed to really like him. Week after week I would go to the pet store and pass by this room. I could not help but notice that while many of the other cages were filled with different cats each week, Ivan never moved. He just sat in his small cage waiting to be adopted. The store lowered his adoption fee several times but, still no one wanted Ivan. It made me very sad to see him sitting there so, on the next trip to the pet store, I took my husband again. I showed him that Ivan was still there and asked an employee to let him meet the lonely cat. It was instant love. Ivan almost jumped into my husbands arms and purred. It was like he knew they were going to be together. I signed some paperwork and bought a few new toys while they got acquainted. My husbands eyes lit up when I came back with a box to take Ivan home in. When we got home, Ivan seemed comfortable like he had always been there."," About two weeks ago I adopted a new cat.

99,Hippocorpus,"A few weeks ago, I had dinner with two of my close friends from high school, Victoria and Tammy. We get together about four times a year to catch up and see how we are all doing. Tammy's life is always full of drama and crazy events because of her relationship with her boyfriend Anthony. She caught us up about all of their fighting, issues, and his crazy family. As usual I gave her my opnion on her horrible situation and I explained to her why they are so toxic to each other. After we were done hanging out, Tammy gave Victoria a ride home. On the way, Tammy made comments to Victoria that she hated my input and that is why she did not tell me anything. Fast forward to a few weeks later, I get a call in the middle of the night. It was Tammy and I let it go to voicemail 3 times before finally answering. Anthony got arrested and she needed bail money or the title to my car. In that moment I realized how toxic she is. I began to question so many things about our friendship and her situation. How can someone not want to hear your advice and opnion but still call you for bail money? How does one get into a sitaution where they do not have $500 in their savings? I realized that Tammy is not the type of person I want in my life. If someone is not making your life better then it is better to just go seperate ways.","A few weeks ago, I had dinner with two of my close friends from high school, Victoria and Tammy.

When I first found out that one of my photos was going to be published, I was so excited and overjoyed that I cried happy tears and could not thank God enough! This was a huge milestone for me as a professional photographer. I called my husband and told him the great news! He was thrilled for me and gave me huge congratulations! I also called or texted other family members to tell them the good news as well. They were also very excited! The photo that was published was a portrait of my son. This made the event even more special. When I got the magazine in the mail I was so happy! I showed the magazine to my son and showed him his portrait and he was very excited as well. The magazine was beautifully printed and I could not believe how gorgeous the portrait looked in it. Everyone in the family was ecstatic! This was a very joyous memory for me in my photography career and definitely a great memory.","I had some of my photography work published in a magazine for the first time. I was very excited.

We have talked about our future and I know he wants to get married. So, I've just been waiting for when he's going to propose. I find myself getting impatient with it but in the end it doesn't matter! We recently went to a football game together and I got it in my head that he would propose there. It didn't happen. We had a good time though. I found myself disappointed and irritable because of something I thought was going to happen. I wish I could get rid of being impatient and just enjoy myself. He is what I want, regardless of a title. The game and my disappoint made me realize how I was thinking. I kept looking for little clues. And it wasn't fair to him to expect something.","I have been dating Michael for over two years now. I am 100% sure he is the one. I really could not be happier with him.

102,Hippocorpus,"We have new neighbors, right next door. I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established. I own my home. I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies.  I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe. Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported, as an individual, as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born. When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied. It reminds me of why I have felt so comfortable and welcome here.","We have new neighbors, right next door. I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established.

I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. <br><br>The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. <br><br>The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies.  <br><br>I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe. Two houses left phone numbers. <br><br>After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. <br><br>I felt very supported, as an individual, as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born. <br><br>When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied. <br><br>It reminds me of why I have felt so comfortable and welcome here.",,"[-0.0063404744, 0.05959044, 0.013364197, 0.04795105, -0.007887735,

103,Hippocorpus,This has been some year for me. When I was a teenager I dreamed of my own family one day. The same dream I've had most of my life. But now that dream has died. I have never been someone woman desire or like. I thought I could overcome that obstacle and have my dream family one day. But it all came crashing down this year. I waited too long and gave too little effort to my dream. Now my health is slowly worsening and no one wants to be with me. It hurts so much when I think of all the years wasted instead of following my dream. When I look at the rest of my life. I will spend the rest of my days regretting my choices and the chances not taken. It's hard to believe but my life is a sad country song. All I can do now is get through each day. Try to make what time I have left have some meaning.,This has been some year for me. When I was a teenager I dreamed of my own family one day. The same dream I've had most of my life.

We ended up going to a water park, which is totally new for me! I've been to regular theme parks, but never a certified water park. I'm glad this is where we went because this day was super fun (even with the perils of summer). As always, the lines to get in were long. It was hot outside. I almost got stung by a bee! It was all well worth it because I got to conquer my fears. Theme park rides scare me. The speed, the slopes, that fluttering feeling in my stomach, the dark tunnels. Getting me on one takes an awful lot of persuasion! However, I faced my fear. I went on one of the most intense rides in the park, and I survived! I was screaming the whole way down, but I did it. I am proud of myself and had so much fun!","It's always nice to spend time with my family. We usually don't all get together often, but I'm glad that we did this time.

105,Hippocorpus,"This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.","This event occurred over 3 months ago.

He was telling her all sorts of lies to sway her into thinking I'm a bad guy in efforts to win her over. Fortunately, she told me and I was really mad because I was being betrayed by someone I trusted. I forgave him in my heart but I can't be friends with him anymore. I just can't bring myself to trusting him and considering him my friend anymore. What's sad is that he's put my life out of balance now because I don't trust anyone anymore because of that betrayal. That being said, I was happy that my fiancee trusted me enough to alert me about it and get my side before believing anything that friend was telling her. I appreciate her now more than ever and know that whatever life throws at us we'll get through it if we trust each other enough to communicate about everything, good or bad. This event helped me learn a few important lessons. One is that we get betrayed by the people we trust most. Second is that communication is key to success in a relationship.","I recently found out that one of my best friends was badmouthing me to my fiancee because he had a thing for her.

All of the practice tests I have encountered included learning derivatives, something that I barely learned as I took calculus as a high school senior. I am questioning whether or not I should become an elementary school teacher, because I have to calculate derivatives without a calculator in less than a week. I laugh at the ridiculousness of teacher's exams, with a 54 percent fail rate on the first try and then a quarter never passing. I am not surprised why there is a teacher shortage.

108,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"So we have been friends since about June/July. I was in my first relationship when I met her and only liked her as a friend. That relationship didnt last longer than a month and I'm all over it. But as time went on we became best friends. During this September we've started hanging out a lot more. Most of the time that we hang out we go on walks and we have deep and meaningful conversations all of the time. I've been at her house two times and she has been at my house once. We have so much fun together and her smile feels like rays of sun spreading happiness inside of me. She has told me how much she enjoys spending time with me compared to other people. When I asked her what she meant with that she didn't really expand on it. Our personalities go together perfectly and I really enjoy spending time with her. I've expressed to her how much I like her as a friend and she's told me the same thing. This Monday I slept at her house after we had spent all afternoon hanging out together after school. We cuddled and she came closer to me and I'll just give some examples of interactions that night. I told her that my hand was cold since the window was open and she asked me if I wanted to put my hand inside the back of her hoodie. I proceeded and the scratched her back while we watched a movie. She crept up close to me at night when we were done watching the movie and she put her head on my chest/shoulder. I started scratching her scalp and playing with her hair which I guess she liked. There was more stuff like this such as her grabbing my hand and I hugging her while we slept at night. Her pulling my arm up and around her neck and using it as a pillow. Thing is she is talking to another guy but she has told me that she isn't sure if she likes him. And I ask her about it saying stuff like how's it going with him and she doesn't really respond to that. I don't want to do anything stupid and ruin a fantastic friendship. I now have feelings for her after that night of her showing me affection and cuddling with her. I got to know her better and she's a fantastic woman with a bunch of cool theories and ideas about philosophy, media, and music.","So we have been friends since about June/July.

What a nightmare that was. 3 years ago, I left him. This wonderful, imperfect man who I am head over heels in love with. I moved out. One of the hardest decisions I've had to make. Also, in hindsight, one of the best. We have made our way back to friends, complicated as it may be. Tonight we met at his place for drinks to celebrate a new job for me. Honestly, just an excuse to see him. We drank and smoked and laughed and shared our triumphs and tribulations. I'm here to share this friendship that I treasure more than anything else in this world. I feel like he accepts me as me, quietly encourages me to be more ME. Being with him, for just a couple of hours, is rejuvenating. This feeling, it creates hope, of a future.","I met a man years ago.

110,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"The recent Adam Levine and Try Guy drama has me thinking about this. I think you have to be extremely naive to be surprised at news of celebrities having affairs and whatnot. They all do it. It's really not anybody else's business honestly. It's not like celebrities are obligated to be good role models. Even if their public image is a relatively wholesome one, I find it odd that people lose sight of the fact that these are professional entertainers, it's very clearly just a branding thing and we don't know any of these people.","The recent Adam Levine and Try Guy drama has me thinking about this.

111,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"So, I was brought up with the mindset that I should help everyone in any capacity I can. I met someone about two months ago and within a few weeks, we switched to more personal apps like Instagram and Telegram. We are from very different regions and have different lifestyles so I only see her as my long-distance friend. We had a little argument recently and I discussed it with her in a non-argumentative way and it seems that a solution to every problem she faces is blocked. She keeps threatening me that she will block me and I on the other hand try to solve a misunderstanding through communication without criticizing or anything. Today I decided that it is a waste of time and I should end it, whatever it is. She is quite young, like 22, and today I decided that it is alright if I can't help everyone and prioritize me.","So, I was brought up with the mindset that I should help everyone in any capacity I can.

112,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"My sister and I (she lives in New Brunswick, I live in Newfoundland) talk a lot by text. She's hearing impaired so telephones don't work. We were talking one day about how we sometimes have to avoid the news because it's nothing but sad stories. With our lives being so hectic and stressful, you turn on the TV and there's more stress. What we started doing was searching out good news sites, and we collect them all week (stories like medical breakthroughs, someone who got a good windfall, a poor family winning the lotto, anything like that), and on Fridays we send them to each other. It helps to hear good news weekly, not just bad news. If you're feeling stressed out, I advise you to avoid the news for a few days, and try to seek out good news sites instead. We don't realize how a daily bombardment of bad news affects us personally.","My sister and I (she lives in New Brunswick, I live in Newfoundland) talk a lot by text.

113,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I have been doing housework for about 45 years of my adult life and it has to be the most boring, repetitive, thankless and futile activity that anyone can engage in. I loathe it with a passion and always have and so I have decided to go on permanent strike. I don't like filth so I will keep that under control, but, as for sweeping, dusting, folding, ironing, polishing, vacuuming, scrubbing and all that jazz - I'm out! Since I mostly live alone it is my own mess and I couldn't give two hoots about what anyone else thinks about the state of my home anymore. I just want to spend my time doing things I enjoy without the daily interruptions of housework. I am liberating myself from this prison that is largely done for the benefit of what others think. I'm free. Woo hoo! Does anyone else feel the same way? If you do, just pack it in. Simple as that. If you live with others who can't take the fact that you no longer clean up after them, let them do it if they're old enough. It's just not fair that this horrendous task should become the default responsibility of one person in a household as it so often does. Time to give housework a last goodbye! Don't chew me up. Every family is different. This is just my story and it won't be the same for everyone. I'm just putting it out there because it is where I'm at right now.","I have been doing housework for about 45 years of my adult life and it has to be the most boring, repetitive, thankless and futile activity that anyone can engage in.

115,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I am a digital freelancer, and several years ago I built an online store for my mum's business. She is very old school so I handled the digital stuff and eventually helped her build a 7 figure store on top of my normal day job. She is now wanting to retire and is in the process of final exchanges of contract with a buyer, and the money is going to help her and my dad retire comfortably. So it sounds like a great story, but now that it's wrapping up I've stepped back and have seen with fresh eyes all the things I didn't do well, or things I didn't do at all. The success of the business kind of snowballed far beyond what we really set out for the business to be, and it reached a point where my mum was too old and old school to take it to the next step and where I didn't have the time (even convincing her to use social media was hard let alone using robotic fulfilment warehouses etc). Although I was being partially compensated at the end, I had my own clients to deal with, and after I tried to get several other freelancers on board and it didn't work out, I just did what I could with what time I had. But with the pandemic the whole thing exploded at the same time that I went through two extremely tragic personal losses, and in hindsight I should have just delegated tasks and let the business flourish and should have been less protective. It's true that my parents can retire comfortably because of me, but it's also true that they didn't have a lot more success because of me. I find it very hard to hold these two truths together and I'm scared I'll always think of it and always regret it.","I am a digital freelancer, and several years ago I built an online store for my mum's business.

The success of the business kind of snowballed far beyond what we really set out for the business to be, and it reached a point where my mum was too old and old school to take it to the next step and where I didn't have the time (even convincing her to use social media was hard let alone using robotic fulfilment warehouses etc). <br><br>Although I was being partially compensated at the end, I had my own clients to deal with, and after I tried to get several other freelancers on board and it didn't work out, I just did what I could with what time I had. But with the pandemic the whole thing exploded at the same time that I went through two extremely tragic personal losses, and in hindsight I should have just delegated tasks and let the business flourish and should have been less protective. <br><br>It's true that my parents can retire comfortably because of me, but it's also true that they didn't have a lot more success because of me. I find it very hard to hold these two truths together and I'm scared I'll always think of it and always regret it.","[{'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-09-30', 'submission_id': 'xs4bwk', 'body': ""Don't worry about it, Your parents are retiring comfortably, what more do you want?Sure, it could have gotten bigger, but you don't know if that would have been a good thing.

116,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"So I went to do some maintenance with my barber. I'm in the process (or at least I was before he screwed it up) of letting my hair grow, and decided I wanted it trimmed down just a little bit. I told him that and he said ok. Fast forward 20 min in I'm just doing what we all do at the barber, which is to just look around and occasionally try to understand what your barber is doing. Then I notice the guy was cutting way too close to my head, and the damage was done, 9 months down the drain. I got up, paid and I literally can't look myself in the mirror anymore. I look so ugly, even if told otherwise. I was already low on willpower to keep growing my hair at that awkward mid point and now I gotta do that all over again.","So I went to do some maintenance with my barber.

118,Reddit-Casual Conversations,I grew up in a town of about 7000 people. Not the smallest around but definitely pretty small. Not quite the case of everyone knowing everyone but news got around pretty fast. I remember so many nights just looking up at the stars and marveling at how many there were. In a way I can really appreciate the story from the Bible when God tells Abraham to look up at the stars and he tells him that his descendants will be the number of the stars. I can appreciate it even more now that it has been taken away from me. I now live in a city of 2 million and the stars are just so washed out by light pollution that I think I'm lucky if half a dozen break through the pollution. It genuinely excited me the other day when I could see Jupiter shining bright as it reached its closest point with Earth. But then I felt a moment of melancholy. I realized just how much I miss seeing those uncountable Stars. I miss my hometown. More than I'd ever admit to my parents but I definitely miss it.,I grew up in a town of about 7000 people.

Why I think I'm the least favourite is because I often find them saying something and when I'm about to respond, I see that they're looking at each other, not me. We also play basketball and we are pretty good together as a trio. But I do think they have better chemistry as well when it comes to basketball. Plus they're both better looking than me. As much as I hate to say it, its true. So just that fact makes me feel lesser than them. I'm also an extrovert and they're more so on the introverted side. I feel like when they ask me things I can go on and on and on and on without really knowing. When I catch myself drowning them in my opinion I then have to stop and realise how annoying I really am. I hate it because it's natural. I don't know how to change the fact that I'm more of a talker than a listener. Plus I laugh a lot and make jokes a bit too much sometimes out of boredom, nervousness or just wanting to fit in. I pray that one day I'll be better looking and have a much more interesting, listening type of personality.","So right now at this point in time there are 3 of us.

121,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I don't know if this is the norm for everyone but my social circle would usually avoid talking about financial situations. And I didn't mind that until recently. I'm still a university student while most of my friends have graduated and are working full-time. I'm paying for my own tuition and trying to get a Master degree (those aren't cheap). My waitress salary isn't the best but it covers the basic necessities with a little bit to put into savings. My friend would usually invite to me to go out in fancy and expensive places, which I could afford once or twice but not very often. Unfortunately, sometimes I couldn't find an excuse to get out and went with it and everytime it left me drained and more stressed afterwards due to the amount of money I have wasted. But ever since I started my new course I've had quite a tight budget so I try to save as much as I could. I'm not struggling to make ends meet but I still need to be smart with money in order to make it through university. So I would decline those hangouts and stated my intentions early on that I can't afford it. My friend would usually brush it off as quickly as she could the moment I talked about it and somehow still insist on me going (Like I didn't say I can't afford it 2 sentences ago). Only until recently I've been informed that some don't like to talk about money as it is a sensitive topic which I have to disagree. I'm not begging for their pity, I don't need them to sympathize with me, I only need them to understand my limits and boundaries as we all have different circumstances. Financial struggles isn't something to be ashamed about and it should be discussed between interpersonal relationships.","I don't know if this is the norm for everyone but my social circle would usually avoid talking about financial situations.

I dont recommend being a sad sack though (man Im aging myself lol). Complaining gets old and you are on a tight budget for a very good reason. I feel bad that your friend is so clueless about it and continues to invite you to places that you cant afford. Why doesnt she gift you with the outing? Thats what I would do. Im retired and we are comfortable financially. We give to many charities because we both have been financially strapped in our lives. As for myself, my family was lower, lower middle class. There wasnt a dime to spare. There were 8 of us and going out to dinner, taking vacations, new clothes (I rarely wore anything that wasnt a hand-me-down). Then it was the same during my first marriage (three kids). So now that I have enough money to buy what I need I am happy to share it. We have given our oldest grandchild a used car when he mentioned that he was walking to work. He didnt ask for it. Weve given $ to friends who truly needed it. And when one our 6 kids and his family (were a blended family ) moved into a house, we gave them money for furniture or whatever they chose to spend it on. They were blown away by that and couldnt find the words to say thanks. Our one condition was he couldnt tell anyone in the family  These things are fun for us because we know what its like to be broke. So I absolutely think that being honest about your financial situation is okay. You dont have to be specific but theres nothing wrong with it. Especially when its a temporary thing like studying for your degree.'}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-10-01', 'submission_id': 'xszyuz', 'body': '[removed]'}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-10-01', 'submission_id': 'xszyuz', 'body': 'A very long time ago, I was a starving university student.

Dreary topics to be sure, but it turns out that ignorance in these areas is very expensive. People with money are often insensitive about the situations faced by people who are fiscally challenged or use their economic advantage to exclude the hoi polloi from their social circles.

Because people know they themselves can't cure the disease, or the cure is difficult to obtain/an unknown, people feel bad bringing it up, either because of the pain it will cause them to see the hardship, or because they know the other individual involved is going through something unpleasant.Interesting thing about shame, is it only has power if it influences behavior. Otherwise, in my opinion it just dies off. So the more open you are with talking about finances, the better we'll all be.Help cure that disease by getting it in the public arena.There was a study recently I can't find at the momen, that talked

122,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I'll be 21 this year and it just so turns out that I haven't done anything romantic in my life. Part of it is being kind of ehh in the looks department, and part of it is being shy and not having a lot of opportunities. I don't really put myself out there. I got asked out once by one of my friends in high school and I wasn't interested so I politely told him no and he accepted and we've stayed friends. Sometimes when people are talking about their relationships and romance stuff they want to hear me talk about it and I tell them that I've never done anything. The closest I had was getting asked out once and they act so confused like they can't believe I'm almost 21 and have never been on a date. I've had people straight up think I'm lying. Other times they'll talk to me in private about it and be like ""Wait you actually haven't had your first kiss yet? You're not lying?"" No, I'm seriously not lying. Why would I lie about THAT? Wouldn't it make more sense for me to lie about having dated because it's seen as weird to not have at 21? For the record, I do want to one day be in a relationship, but so far maybe I'm just not relationship material.","I'll be 21 this year and it just so turns out that I haven't done anything romantic in my life.

I use humor to deal with my mom\'s death.  She died at only 52 years old (11 years ago).  She was always the loud funny one, the life of the party.  Her passing was expected but that didn\'t make it any less difficult for the rest of us.  I\'m probably the only one that uses humor to deal with it so I make sure to not use it around the ones that wouldn\'t take kindly to it (only my family).  Out in the wild, out in public though, oh, I have fun with it.  People want to crack ""your mom"" jokes or make the funny ""your mom"" comments and then its on!  Kinda like my mom, she\'s on....on the mantle in an urn.  I know a lot of people find it awkward or inappropriate and I almost care about their opinions, but then I realize I don\'t care at all.  That\'s how I grieve so they can deal or move on.  I did crush a little girl\'s heart once and I felt terrible about it.  The waitress at the restaurant asked if we (me and some guy buddies) wanted to get any gift cards for our moms for mother\'s day because ""everyone has a mom"".  My buddies collectively looked at my as though they were expected something crude to come out of my mouth.  I just told her I was going to have to pass, just like my mom did.  The look on her face and how fast she lost all color from her face, I knew she was devastated.  I felt equally as bad, apologized profusely, and tipped her well.  I actually still feel bad for that one and that was probably 5 years ago.'}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-09-27', 'submission_id': 'xpkd13', 'body': 'This is my family.

If Mom was cracking jokes, he knew things were going to be okay.To be fair, not everybody works like this, so I wouldn\'t recommend it to anybody outside my family.

126,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"Halloween costumes are so fun. My friends and I like to do group costumes. 2 years ago we dressed up as the cast of Tiger King and that was great. We had Joe Exotic, his husband, Carole Baskin, Jeff Lowe, and a tiger. Last year we did Peter pan and we had Peter, tinkerbell, captain hooke, smee, and the tick tock croc. This year we want to do wrestlers but I'm having trouble deciding on a wrestler to be. Reconciling skimpy wrestler leotards with freezing cold Halloween weather is tough.","Halloween costumes are so fun.

127,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"Anytime I am hanging out with friends they always have their phones out, taking pictures and videos of what we are doing and posting it on Snapchat. I am totally cool with pictures and videos as I take them myself for memories. I just don't understand posting everything you do. Being with my friends I kinda let it slide and don't really say much other than a snarky comment from time to time. However, my Mom is the same way. She is always posting pictures any time we spend family time together, like playing a board game or something like that. I've asked her why she does it and that I would really rather not be blasted on social media if I am just chilling at home, but she just always gets mad and says okay she won't do it anymore. Am I wrong for not wanting to be put on social media when I am just chilling at home? At this point, I just expect it when out in public, and never say anything. I feel like being at home is different though.","Anytime I am hanging out with friends they always have their phones out, taking pictures and videos of what we are doing and posting it on Snapchat.

128,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"Today an Instagram scammer pretending to be someone else decided to target me. They were obviously a scammer, but I was bored and decided I wanted to have a chat with the scammer so I pretended to fall for it and entered a video call with them. I was fully aware that they were going to record it, but I was curious to see what they would threaten to do with it. When they revealed themselves they decided to threaten to show it to everyone I follow (Which is fine since I doubt any of them would care all too much, and maybe even find it funny), unless I gave them 7000. I told them I only had 200, expecting them to negotiate, but apparently they are stupid enough to expect someone to even consider paying the initial amount. After that, I proceded to give them tips on how to scam more convincingly, and then said I'd pay them 100 for photos of them. During this, he got increasingly angry and kept screaming until he left without making more attempts to get money. Overall it was pretty funny and seemed mostly risk-free. I have no idea if they followed up on the threats yet though.","Today an Instagram scammer pretending to be someone else decided to target me.

Both times they were bullshit reasons which had nothing to do with my conscientiousness or professionalism.  One was I was hired in at more the than the owner could afford, so similar to business being run bad.  What I didnt see till looking back was it created positive opportunity.  I was one of those people who get stuck in a job that was kind of beneath my abilities, but I was too scared to challenge myself with jobs outside my comfort zone.  I ended up doing this and it changed my life.  Being fired was one of the luckiest experiences Ive had in my life.  It put me on a position where I was forced to have to seek a dynamic change and I used that to say, instead of doing work that is comfortable, let me try something I actually want to do.

130,Reddit-Casual Conversations," Recently I was watching I survived: Beyond and Back on Hulu, a show about near death experiences, and these people often report seeing loved ones who have already passed on. Their parents, their aunts and uncles, their ex spouse, a close friend, etc. Based on these experiences some people have had, it seems that when you die, usually someone you knew in life who has already passed on comes to guide you to the afterlife. I sometimes wonder who I will see. It might be someone who you don't really think about, because maybe they didn't play a huge role in your life, but maybe you made a big difference in theirs, and so they want to be the first to welcome you."," Recently I was watching I survived: Beyond and Back on Hulu, a show about near death experiences, and these people often report seeing loved ones who have already passed on.

131,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I work remotely, and I'm an extrovert who loves people watching. As such, a couple of times a week I go to the mall and sit at the Starbucks near me. Today, a stranger walked in and ordered their drink and sat down at their table. The place was super busy so I never gave it a second thought, however the way this person was sitting looked a bit odd. I looked at them a little closer (in a non-obvious way) and noticed that they were covering their face with their hands and were desperately trying to hold back tears. I felt terrible for this person and after thinking about it for a few minutes, I decided I'd get them a doughnut or a cookie or something to try and cheer them up. So I got up and went to another shop, and while I was there I wrote on a piece of paper: ""Hey, I noticed that you don't seem okay. Whatever it is that's bothering you, I hope it gets better and you feel better soon. Here's a cookie, hopefully it helps you feel better! P.S Sorry if this is awkward. Well just as I went back to Starbucks to try and give it to them, they were gone. At some point between me thinking I should do something and actually doing it, they got up and left. I feel so terrible right now. I feel so bad for that person, I don't know what they were going through but it didn't look like it was good. If only I had acted a bit quicker I might have been able to make a difference, no matter how small. I feel really heartbroken. I just hope they're okay wherever they are and that they feel better soon.","I work remotely, and I'm an extrovert who loves people watching.

133,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"So just an hour ago I received a notification from my school that my class will start our new semester today and we'll have to study online. Doesn't sound bad at all until I remembered that the school staff told us way back in August (when the last semester ended) that the new semester wouldn't begin until November, and that we'd go to school as normal. After reading this I was terrified, like full on panicked. I began refreshing the facebook page where I received the news over and over again, went to recheck my emails multiple time, digging up old notifications to see if there were any mistakes. There weren't so I went back and saw that our class was full of students, and then it clicked. You see, the reason I had to wait for a few months to continued studying in the first place was because too many people had dropped out of my class, and the school had to close it until more people has joined. The moment we had enough students for the class again, they reopened it and didn't inform anyone until the very last minute. But knowing this didn't help me calm down at all, instead I just got more panicked. I know I shouldn't be worrying over such an unwanted but ultimately minor surprise, but I just can't stop.","So just an hour ago I received a notification from my school that my class will start our new semester today and we'll have to study online.

I say this as a person who has tried and struggled to learn a few languages. (My current Duolingo course is GLARING at me)Second, I understand your panic with suddenly changing circumstances. Last semester, my laptop broke down. Because I\'d structured my plans in a particular way (ADHD forced me to make up priorities when it doesn\'t come naturally to me, so I chose to work on whatever assignment was due next instead of adapting to circumstances), I panicked at the thought of altering my plan which had already worked for a whole semester. Unfortunately, since I tend to learn my lessons the hard way (after something significant has happened), I may not be able to help. But if I could go back, I\'d do exactly what you said helps you: talk it through. (Maybe someone could have talked sense into me.) Talking through things can help. Also, for what it\'s worth, saying you ""shouldn\'t"" be panicking may be true, but it\'s usually not helpful and can even make things worse. Fear is how your brain tries to protect you. When you resist, your brain tries harder to tell you how ""bad"" it\'s convinced the situation is until you\'re back to ""safety"". Sounds silly, but looking at it from this perspective could help. Arguing with your brain might not help, but reframing your thoughts might. I got that one in therapy.'}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-09-29', 'submission_id': 'xqx6gn', 'body': ""Obviously you can't control what just happened with your classes.

134,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I was at the checkout this morning, waiting behind a mom and her 4/5 year old daughter. She had a cart full of Halloween decorations. Cutesy things like plush pumpkins and wreaths and scarecrows. The mom was at the end of the counter sorting out her reusable shopping bags. The child was unloading the cart. She was just jumping with excitement. The level in the cart got so low that the kid couldn't reach over the edge. So she did what any kid would do. She climbed the side. The cart started to tip, so I reached out to steady it. I guess Mom caught my movement out of the corner of her eye, because she whipped around, grabbed the kid, and started scolding her. Which, understandable. I startled her and her kid scared her. She stands the kid on the ground and starts emptying the cart. And this is where it starts to go off the rails.....The kid is watching with such a look of longing on her face. It was pitiful. The mom completely ignores her. Like she's not even there. Now, me. I would've done one of two or three things. I would've braced that cart with my feet and invited her to climb on up and have at it. Or picked the kid up and put her in the cart so she could hand things out. Or, at the very least, handed the things from the cart to the kid to put on the counter. So, when the mom turns towards the cashier, the kid starts climbing the cart again. Mom catches her again and scolds more harshly. Now the kid is standing there, staring at the floor, trying not to cry. Mom is doing the ignoring thing again. I'm trying not to notice. Then, the thing that absolutely burned my bacon...Last thing mom picked up out of the cart is this gorgeous child's Halloween mask. It's got fake painted lashes and adorable makeup and is trimmed around the edges with fluffy little feathers. Mom holds it in her hand, looks at the kid and says, ""You didn't really want this anyway, did you?"" In this bored, mean girl kind of voice. And the kid just looks at the mask. Follows with her eyes as mom puts it back on the shelf. I've never wanted to slap someone so much in my life. Poor kid.","I was at the checkout this morning, waiting behind a mom and her 4/5 year old daughter. She had a cart full of Halloween decorations.

I was verbally abused by a very narcissistic mother from a very young age, now IF the mother did sound like a cruel bully and put the mask back for no reason and was being unnecessarily cruel the whole time then yeah thats 100% exactly some shit my mother would pull and Id say that poor child. But you didnt say she was rude the first two times she told her to get down from the cart. She was buying a cart full of fun decorations and stuff the child will be helping her set up when they get home making a fun decorating day. The mother ignored her because were supposed to stare at and talk to our children every single second while were trying to check out before a complete and total breakdown happens from an exhausted and overstimulated child when we have 2 more errands to run after the Halloween store? You have no idea whats going on in their lives. And you happening to add at the end how she stole candy, like youre trying to make her look worse, IF that happened too then the mother might have been out of money and couldnt buy the mask and got a candy bar to give the child in the car to make her feel better. Does it make it right? No. But again, whole lot of judgment for what sounds like a tired parent in a rough place and a child whos not listening that you as an outsider looking in as an abused child now '}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-09-29', 'submission_id': 'xqmxp3', 'body': ""I have 2 small kids. I can *almost* guarantee you that the mother's reaction was a culmination of things **ending** with the kid hanging off the side of the cart and not an immediate reaction to that particular action. Sometimes you're trying to do something fun and nice for/with your kid and they're being awful the whole time. At that point, you have to face the fact that the 'fun' and 'nice' thing you're doing was probably more for you than them. It's something you were hoping they would enjoy, but they're clearly not, and they're making you not enjoy it as well. She probably wanted to have 'fun' decorating and doing some cute things with her kid and her kid was sending some obvious signs of not really caring throughout the whole trip, culminating in some 'final straw' thing that you witnessed (probably some conversation about not climbing the cart that had been repeated 12 times before this point). Still, young kids don't like things being taken away. Even if the child was whining and hated everything up until that moment, they would most likely be sad finding out that these things they didn't even care for were being taken away.Honestly, this is one of the worst parts of being a parent: knowing how many super judgemental people are out there who see you doing something other than being an awestruck selfless ball of joy around your child and assume you're an awful human being for it. I think this is a general problem in our society. On top of the pressure of actually trying to raise a decent human, you know that every exasperated sigh or moment of showing that you're a human that occasionally gets frustrated is being turned into judgement soup by someone out there.""}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-09-29', 'submission_id': 'xqmxp3', 'body': ""Hey there, u/rusty0123 this submission has been removed because: **Dont post to vent, complain, or express sadness**  Stay positive.

135,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I don't know about anyone else, but September has been so rough for me. Just a lot of family drama, falling back on some bad habits, but I'm holding out for October. I feel weirdly elated for the changing of the month, I don't know why. Wake me up when September ends, am I right? Halloween is one of my favorite holidays even though I hate horror, and autumn is my favorite season. I'm not even doing anything for Halloween, but I still feel somewhat excited. Plus, maybe it'll finally feel like fall so I can wear all the new sweaters I got when I went thrift shopping in July with my Nana. Once I start working, I think I might go and try a pumpkin spice latte.","I don't know about anyone else, but September has been so rough for me.

To be honest, I'm pretty happy with our line up right now and I'm not really looking to recruit more people than we need. I appreciate his enthusiasm but it always irks me that some people who have little to no experience try to invite themselves in the band especially when we never asked them to join in the first place. I've had this happen a few times over the years and it's always uncomfortable to deal with. I just really don't want to have to take time out of our rehearsals to make sure this guy is up to speed and having to help him along the way. We need experienced people who know what they're doing. I've been playing guitar/bass for 10 plus years and didn't even start playing in bands until 3 years ago. I don't know how he expects to keep up considering he just started learning a few months ago. Maybe I'm just way too polite but I don't know how to break it to this guy without coming across as rude or mean. When he's asked me about coming to rehearsals or learning songs I'll give something along the lines of a maybe which probably doesn't help the situation much.","I'm in a three piece psych rock band and we've finally been going out and playing shows locally.

That way you avoid feeling satisfied by just planning, and you actually get something done.Another trick would be to tell yourself that you are going to start one task. Not doing it, not finishing it, just starting. Just tell yourself you are going to do your task for just 5 minutes, then even if it's not finished, you will stop.

Keep going.'}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-10-02', 'submission_id': 'xto75y', 'body': ""Yep, welcome to the club. On the joking sidw. Maybe it's for better though.

What I've noticed is that I don't manage a change in activity very well.  If I decide to have 'a little sit down', I'll find it hard to get up again, for example. Or I lie in bed without getting up, or don't go to bed even though I'm actually tired.So I've learned to just get on with what I want to do as soon as possible. I'll come home from work and do the house work straight away, and only have a rest after I've finished. Once I'm in 'house work mode', I can just potter on all day, with brief periods of rest, but I have to be really focused to limit those rest periods so I don't go into 'sitting down mode' again.Reading this back, it sounds absolutely mental, but it's the best way I can describe it.""}]","[0.010465751, 0.022293093, 0.004303537, -0.023977846, -0.009868663, 0.011023668, -0.06036293,

He messaged me today on Sunday. He always ghosts me, takes days to respond to me, and it's just unprofessional. He wanted me to ask around and see if anyone would be interested so I made a social media post and got responses immediately and gave him his number. He messaged me a minute ago over something different and I casually asked him if he got any messages for the position. He responded ""yes but I'm not working I'm off today of course"".  I know he's off and I'm supposed to be off too, but here I am dealing with people interested, pointing them his way, and pretty much doing all the work. I'm not even getting paid for helping him find potential employees so I'll just quit responding to people. I've been through so much with this cleaning company. I got reported over some rooms not being cleaned which was not my fault because my key card didn't give me access to those rooms until the end of July. I've been working since April. I tried to miss work the other day due to a stomach virus and he wouldn't let me, afraid I'd get reported again because that would make him look bad. I tried to miss a week because my grandpa had a heart attack and he wouldn't let me take care of him and got upset about me missing work just for four days. I'm so excited for this new job where I'll be working with children. The pay is higher too.","So I work for a cleaning company and clean buildings by myself. I enjoy being by myself anyways.

All the mangers in my area have worked less then me (1y + a month) at my job, but they are supossed to advise me what to do and keep me safe. The two head people at my building are toxic and will over work you. One of them is a man who has been trying to get one of my co-worker fired from day one (my co-worker is 5 years at this job just out of spite for him), he had to move to our building due to harassment in the work place, only like yes-men, lies to you constantly about what he says or you say, dosen\'t care (even wishing) people get injured at work, and no one in the building likes him. Those two guys also will get anyone who is injured to sing a paper or admit the injur was there fault and get mad at anyone who files worker comp. You are contiunely asked to do 2 or more people\'s jobs. If you say yes one day, you are then expected to do it until you move off that spot. Our pay got by 20% at the start of this year, and no one in management can figuer out why new hires won\'t stay. Your managers get mad at you if you don\'t do 100% and your assignment is perfect. And on top of that you also get blamed for other people in the department failing on doing their job. Our building is known to permote people who suck at our job or no one likes, just to ""get rid"" of them. If you are bad you get help 5 miunties in to the shift. If you are good, you get to do 3 peoples assignment then get told the pain youbfelt dosent excict. One part in the building isn\'t cared about at all and is a weather/safety hazard due to ice forming over the ground in winter. And no one placing de-icer on the ground forcing the employees to steal some, hide it, and use it. A manger also told another co-worker of mine that she should just ingur herself to get time off work (not a joke). That was when we were being forced to work 6 - 8 hours l, 6 days a week, forced to work past the safe load limit, and no lunch break. My job is also a manual labor job which has lost of lifting invloved, inculding +100lbs objects. In short...I am so excited to leave this job and I wish you well that your new job has a WAY better boss then your last one or mine.'}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-10-03', 'submission_id': 'xu4ux1', 'body': 'Why the FUCK are you advertising the position for him?

Life felt meaningless even though at that time the job came with a great salary, and I was living in a big city. After a year and a half I left my exhausting job. Today, I just signed an offer letter from a job that I want! I'm really proud of myself considering this is not an easy job to get. The interview took three days with about 100+ candidates. To imagine I'm one of the people who managed to pull this off is really an amazing feeling. I'm really happy and wishing everyone who's wanting to change their jobs or life in general, a very best of luck!","Previously I worked at a very exhausting workplace, full of toxic people.

Now I just have one best friend but things are weird between us... and I don't know how I feel about it.

supposed to be happy and rememberable, but it\'s not really for most people. i guess i kind of wish things were better so i could have had a better ""16th"" but i guess there\'s more birthdays to

143,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I'm 28, married to my partner who is 26. We have a year and a half old kid and own a home with a yard. We do activism in our community for lgbtq rights and have been disowned by half our family. I went to the local humane society the other day to check out a dog. I brought along my kid to make sure they were compatible and comfortable with each other. The dog I was originally looking at was way too timid and not comfortable so they brought out a different one that fit our household needs, as we also have a cat. It went great! The dog and kid got along. The dog was timid at first but warmed up after like 2 minutes and the kid knows how to approach and pet gently as we've been training with her since she was 6 months. They said they couldn't release her just yet and to come back 2 days (today) from now. I wanted to have my partner meet the dog first so it fit well in our schedule anyway. When we got to the shelter the same person was working and took us to a different room. We waited for about 10 minutes until she came back and said there was a problem. They had received 2 anonymous calls saying we weren't in the right place to adopt an animal. No name or anything left so they don't know who it was. They apologized profusely and said they couldn't give us the dog, but that there were no other red flags and they didn't get a bad vibe from us. They said they would email their manager to reconsider but they likely won't hear back until tomorrow. We've had smear campaigns against us because of our activism, mostly calling us groomers, and I've been afraid they would call cps on us but I never expected them to call the humane society. I'm just totally baffled and deflated. We likely will be able to adopt the dog, but the fact someone would call to prevent it, I can't believe it. If we are able to adopt the dog, her name will be Biscuit.","I'm 28, married to my partner who is 26. We have a year and a half old kid and own a home with a yard. We do activism in our community for lgbtq rights and have been disowned by half our family. <br><br>I went to the local humane society the other day to check out a dog. I brought along my kid to make sure they were compatible and comfortable with each other. The dog I was originally looking at was way too timid and not comfortable so they brought out a different one that fit our household needs, as we also have a cat. It went great! The dog and kid got along. The dog was timid at first but warmed up after like 2 minutes and the kid knows how to approach and pet gently as we've been training with her since she was 6 months. <br><br>They said they couldn't release her just yet and to come back 2 days (today) from now. I wanted to have my partner meet the dog first so it fit well in our schedule anyway. When we got to the shelter the same person was working and took us to a different room.

144,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"Today I was talking with a friend in school. Beside him were two of his friends from his class. We were waiting for a teacher to bring a ball so we could hoop a little before I went home. But there was this girl beside him who was one of his mates. During the conversation with me and my friend, she kept looking at me weirdly and then looking away when I looked back. In a weird way. Almost staring at me. When I said bye and turned my back, she started talking. And it felt like she was talking negatively about me behind my back. She was so awkward the whole way through as I was talking with my friend. I had this sudden feeling of anger and hatred just rising within me. I had an overwhelming amount of hatred. I have never felt so angry and hateful towards someone for looking at me weirdly. It stuck with me in my head until all the way home. I stopped and tried to observe why I felt this way. But I couldn't understand. Worse things have happened in my life and I felt more passive about it. But this... It nearly ruined my whole day and I couldn't stop thinking about it.","Today I was talking with a friend in school.

145,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"For as long as I remember I always wanted to be famous and in the last five years I actually became obsessed with it and have done a lot of things. But I was watching a few biopics of some very famous people, and I find most of them are actually very lonely within and some of them even have a disaster life. It's scary how actually media and people just want to use your fame for their own benefit. I'm thinking is it even worth trying? I know many people who are actually on the same path as me.","For as long as I remember I always wanted to be famous and in the last five years I actually became obsessed with it and have done a lot of things. <br><br>But I was watching a few biopics of some very famous people, and I find most of them are actually very lonely within and some of them even have a disaster life.

146,Reddit-Casual Conversations,"I joined the army in 2013 right out of high school and left literally 2 days ago. The Army sucked. I was initially an 88M but then reclassed to 25Q in 2017 and then did basically nothing. I got a lot of stupid stories I can share, but the basic thing is it just feels weird this chapter of my life is over and done with. Also, despite how much it sucked, I don't regret it. I met a ton of awesome people I otherwise wouldn't have, got to go to both Japan and South Korea, and got two degrees - English and Communications - for free. My dad tried to talk me into staying for the full 20, but I was just done with it all. I was so tired with it all. On my final final day, I was scheduled for a PT test and decided to take it really just for old times sake and to say goodbye to everyone another time and just chat. It was honestly nice to get to say goodbye to everyone again and plus I got a good score on this final PT test that doesn't mean anything. I was literally not in the Army anymore on the day I took it which was kinda funny. Sad a part is over, but happy as a new chapter in my life is starting. I look forward to what comes next.","I joined the army in 2013 right out of high school and left literally 2 days ago. The Army sucked.

147,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I was abused as a child physically and mentally and have always been a people pleaser. I'm sure it comes from the constant need to win my parents' approval as well as the fear that I would be beaten if I got in trouble. I've been molested as a child by a distant relative we went to visit and have never told anyone because I feel ashamed or that I might get in trouble with my parents. Would they say it's my fault? Would they believe me? All of these things weighing on a 9 year old was a lot so I didn't say anything and just tried to forget it happened. In high school I got bullied by teachers at this school I went to. For example, some of my classmates goofed around and somehow I got the blame for not telling on them. Of course I was too scared to go home and tell because I'm sure I would've been told it's my fault. I really was a good student, got along with all my peers, and made some amazing friends whom I'm in touch with still. A lot later in life my parents wanted me to get married so I did. My husband is a great guy but his mother doesn't get along with me and our relationship starts to break because of it. I had severe depression and she constantly picked away at me even more after we had our first baby. We are now on a very low contact basis with her and have moved out. Overall I feel I'm just a very bitter person because of everything that's happened and I suppose more than anyone I hate myself for not standing up for me when I should have. I'm at a point in my life where I've set boundaries so people can't overstep them and upset me and I'm not a doormat like I used to be. I do have the urge to call my parents and scream at them for how they raised me because my other siblings did not endure the kind of abuse I did but what good would actually come of it? They can't undo it. My husband is really supportive but I haven't told him everything. I feel like it would break his heart and I'm ashamed of some of it too.","I was abused as a child physically and mentally and have always been a people pleaser.

148,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I've experienced suicidal thoughts since I was around 18 and I really struggle to feel valid in mental health/depression-related spaces. I feel alone in my everyday life to begin with and don't have anywhere to find a community. My depression/suicidal thoughts don't stem from any sort of trauma or life circumstances. I have had an overwhelmingly good life, good relationships with family, friends, got a job and moved out shortly after graduating college, making a living wage. That's partly why it's so frustrating that my mental health is still so bad. I feel guilty for feeling suicidal when there is literally nothing wrong with my life. Right now I feel like things are bad enough for me to be completely miserable but not bad enough for anyone to care. At the same time, it feels messed up and attention-seeking. I just want to feel like someone understands and I've never felt like anyone really gets it.","I've experienced suicidal thoughts since I was around 18 and I really struggle to feel valid in mental health/depression-related spaces.

150,Reddit-Off My Chest,"My sister is evil. Her appearance is striking: platinum blonde hair like it's still the year 2000, adorning makeup which is reminiscent of Ursula, and false eyelashes so thick you wonder if they might wiggle away like a caterpillar. Always in pink, and always carrying her cigarettes. When people meet her, she performs the role of a submissive. She's just an innocent stay at home mom. She does not hesitate to ask for help. But it never, ever stops. I now have $15,000 lessons on being grifted. I have also gained friends that were grifted too. There's always a reason she asks for money, yet she keeps those who help at a distance so we don't actually know where the money goes. She has no shame in asking for money and favors. She progressively escalates over time to see how much she can get out of someone, and disappears the rest of the time. Then there's the lying. She is a pathological liar, and I don't say that lightly. For my mom's funeral last month, I paid for 100% of it. I told my sister that I wasn't giving her any more money, and that she hurt me a few days before the event. My sister didn't show up to the service, and told everyone there that she believed I would not acknowledge her son there. Her son, who I've been there for since day 1 and had nothing to do with us. She also wished for my mom's death so she could receive inheritance. She's just a total garbage human and it sucks to be related to her.","My sister is evil.

151,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I just got a puppy. He's really cute and overall fairly well behaved for only being 2 months old. My mom and little brother love the dog, but he is supposed to be ""my dog"", and I kind of don't want him. I don't know why I feel this way, especially since we've only had him since last week. I feel really bad about it and I don't know what to do about it either. I've never had a pet, but I've wanted a dog for a few years now. I really thought I wanted one. I was super happy when we first brought him home and was excited out of my mind for the first few days. He's sleeping in my room, but he's annoying me a lot. ( I get annoyed easily, unfortunately ). He keeps biting my bed and a chair I have in my room that used to be my grandma's. I understand that his teeth are itchy, but he has a ton of toys he could bite. I however have no problems taking him out on walks and whatnot. I'm also a naturally messy person, so having a dog and having to keep my room clean at all times is really annoying for me. I am also suspecting that I might have ADD because I have a really hard time cleaning/going to school/and really doing anything even slightly time consuming. The thing is also kinda that whenever I'm in school, I have to go home at lunch to take him outside and play with him. This has also complicated things more, so I haven't been in school at all since we got him. And on top of that, I can't really afford to get much more school absence, or I'm going to have to retake a grade (again). I had big problems just getting myself to school before, and now it's just so much harder with him to think about. I think I've romanticized the whole ""having a puppy"" thing, unfortunately.","I just got a puppy. He's really cute and overall fairly well behaved for only being 2 months old.

You need to tell them because its not fair if you\'re not going to put in the amount of time/energy that\'s required to raise him. If your family is willing to make it the ""family dog"" &amp; help out, then consider yourself lucky. If not, it\'s best you rehome it sooner rather than later.

152,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I think my boyfriend's gonna propose soon!! I've been with my boyfriend for over 4 years and have lived with him for a good part of the relationship. I was recently on his computer and an email popped up from a ring retailer saying something along the lines of ""nice meeting you the other day"". As I clicked into the email (we share emails for subscriptions) I saw the price of the ring. I was not expecting the amount to be so much! I told him previously that I wanted a ring below $3k and would rather spend the extras on a house but I'm so excited!! I quickly closed the email but I'm glad that they provided pics in a link so I didn't accidentally see it but I'm so excited. He kept asking me previously if I would wear a ring if he ever bought me one so it's no surprise there but I'm still over the moon.","I think my boyfriend's gonna propose soon!!

I was recently on his computer and an email popped up from a ring retailer saying something along the lines of ""nice meeting you the other day"". As I clicked into the email (we share emails for subscriptions) I saw the price of the ring. I was not expecting the amount to be so much! <br><br>I told him previously that I wanted a ring below $3k and would rather spend the extras on a house but I'm so excited!! I quickly closed the email but I'm glad that they provided pics in a link so I didn't accidentally see it but I'm so excited. <br><br>He kept asking me previously if I would wear a ring if he ever

153,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I hate being female in this society. I hate body standards. I hate society for making me grow up comparing my body to everyone around me, seeing only one body type to look up to in media. I hate that body types go in and out of trend. I hate that skinny is an accessory. I hate that I grew up with family monitoring my body in a way they didn't do for my brother. I hate how impressed everyone was when I lost my appetite for a year. I hate how much better I got treated once I lost weight. I hate that I wasn't even given the chance to accept my body before it started giving out. I hate that it's easier to tell people about my medical history than it would be to tell them I gained 10 pounds. I hate how much it's all shaped me. I hate that no matter how hard I try I can't reverse the harm.","I hate being female in this society. I hate body standards.

155,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I've been hanging out with this girl for a few months and we became great friends. There was always some underlying tension between us, but neither of us acted on it. We hung out a couple of times, cuddled, but nothing more. To be honest, I'm not sure what I wanted from her. I guess I just wanted support. I wanted someone to share how I felt with. I had recently been through a bad breakup and I was doing everything self destructive I could think of. I wanted affection and comfort but I didn't have the energy to give any of it back. She did. She would always talk to me, help me through the day, comfort me, and encourage me to take care of myself. She would buy me anything I needed for myself, she cooked me homecooked meals. She would constantly check up on me. And to be honest, I was kind of a bad friend. I wasn't as caring and considerate as she was. I didn't really give her much comfort even though I depended on her for her care. After trauma dumping on her for a while and doing some inconsiderate things, she started distancing herself from me. I thought that it was always just the fact that she was kind of pretty and giving me the support I needed that made me attracted to her. In my mind, I labeled her as replaceable and a placeholder. But she's not that. She's genuinely funny, kind, beautiful, smart, and caring. She's everything a guy could want in a girl, but now she avoids me. I'm still not sure what I want out of this, but I know I made a mistake. And at this point I have no idea how to fix it.","I've been hanging out with this girl for a few months and we became great friends. There was always some underlying tension between us, but neither of us acted on it. We hung out a couple of times, cuddled, but nothing more. To be honest, I'm not sure what I wanted from her. I guess I just wanted support. I wanted someone to share how I felt with. <br><br>I had recently been through a bad breakup and I was doing everything self destructive I could think of. I wanted affection and comfort but I didn't have the energy to give any of it back. She did. She would always talk to me, help me through the day, comfort me, and encourage me to take care of myself.

156,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I don't really know what real life friends are anymore. I had friends in elementary and middle school. I would always talk to them and we would laugh and do stuff together but we would never interact outside of school. After Covid hit most of my friends moved and anyone who stayed doesn't talk to me willingly. I don't understand why. Thinking about it I began to realize that they weren't real friends. They were people who I interacted with just to make school bearable. I began to realize that I had no real friends and wouldn't have any for the rest of my school life. People say your high school years are your best years but that hasn't been the case. I have become the really quiet kid who literally only spoke if he had to. I actively try to make sure no one knows who I am and hope no one will remember me. I feel empty and can't imagine having friends in real life again. I have online friends and have known them for years. They are the best thing to ever happen to me but I don't think I'll ever be able meet them in real life due to real life being a monster, money reasons and me being young. So I'm stuck here wondering if I'm going to be alone. If my online friends will eventually move on and I'll be completely alone. I feel I will forget what having friends is like and what a friend is. I can already imagine sitting in a dimly lit apartment and staring at the ceiling, empty, alone, and wondering what the point of everything is. I wouldn't cry though because I am actively losing the ability to. I just wonder if I will at least have friends in the future or if I will be completely alone, a shell doing stuff on autopilot.","I don't really know what real life friends are anymore.

157,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I feel alone. It is so frustrating. I used to be fine with it, but then for some reason I actually started wanting to have a friend. I have nobody. And nobody around me seems interesting enough to me. Life gets boring. And frustrating. I am a frustrated person. I want to feel romantic love but I only feel it for my ex, and it is the slightest amount so I cling onto it. I don't know if I'm aromantic or something. It is so frustrating having to chase that feeling. My ex was the only one ever to give me a slight feeling of romance. I do not get crushes. I would never kiss someone, touch makes me cringe. But I want the picture perfect life. Nothing will make me stop wanting a wife and family. And my ex is the only one I could possibly have it with. I am so lonely and I know it is just messing with my head. Nobody understands me. People think I'm weird and crazy. Everyone does. Nobody is here for me. Nobody knows who I really am. And I feel like I can't relate with anybody all of the time. People frustrate me so much yet I need them to fill some void in me. I worry. I distract myself with school, but each day I come home and it's the same. The feeling of dread. I hate myself. I hate everything. I've been less timid. Trying to be more approachable looking. It doesn't work. I put myself in situations to talk to people. We don't get past surface level stuff. I am trapped in this isolation. It gets me so mad. I am trying. I physically can't speak at times and I have to use hand gestures a lot. I can't speak! What else am I supposed to do?! My voice is wrong when I do manage to speak. It is not expressive or funny. People think I have no emotion and I am so serious. I just want to be normal. I am not normal. Something is wrong with me but I don't know what. I just want a real friend.","I feel alone.

158,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I wasn't really ever that close with my mother. I would see her as a child when I could, because she had diabetes and her mental health was bad. She also had substance issues and a new boyfriend every 3 months. One day my grandma gets a call that my mom is in the hospital. That day I decided to not go into her hospital room because I was used to visiting her in the hospital due to her health. I always regret that I didn't go see her. I don't even remember the last time I saw her alive. She was in a coma. I was 11 years old when she died. My mom was friends with drug addicts, and what not so I never knew fully how she died. Some of my family members told me it was from heroine. Others say it was her diabetes. I don't even know who was with her when she spoke her last words. She died a couple weeks after I just started middle school. I felt so alone. The last time I saw her was in an open casket with 10 pounds of makeup to cover up. I was still grieving so I decided to skip her funeral because I was scared.","I wasn't really ever that close with my mother.

159,Reddit-Off My Chest,My girlfriend broke up with me. It's been terrible. I miss her and want her back everyday. I don't know how she's doing and maybe she's doing fine. Maybe she's missing me too. I love her and wish I could change things. I think one of the worst parts about this is how my mind makes things up or when I get a bad thought in my head I can't get it out. I love her more than I could ever express. I wanted to spend my life doing my best to express the love I have for her. I hope that one day we can get back together. She is amazing. So beautiful and smart and funny. Her personality is amazing and the things she'd do for me were lovely. Sometimes I wish someone could fix this or that I could rewind time. But right now I'm just going to work on myself and do what I need. Whether or not she wants to be a part of that is her decision. I just would be really really really happy if she is a part of that.,My girlfriend broke up with me. It's been terrible. I miss her and want her back everyday.

Focus on yourself thats all you can do. My Mom told me something once that has always stuck with me when it comes to relationships: chemistry is one thing, but timing is everything. Sometimes you can be perfect for each other, but the timing is just so off. And you cant control that. Keep that same energy though: work on yourself, work on the things you can control.

161,Reddit-Off My Chest,"Before I went through my trauma, I cared about every little thing people said or thought about me. I cared about life and thought life had meaning and I played an important role. But after growing up and going through hard times, I just stopped caring. In some ways, I feel like I'm better. I'm not anxious anymore, I don't let what other people say get to me, I help people without getting personally invested. It's not like I don't care at all, but it's not enough. But through this apathy, I realize I hurt my partner, my friends and family (and even implicitly my coworkers and other peers). I believed that my words and actions ultimately don't affect anyone because they don't respect or care about me enough for it to affect them. I don't share significant parts of my life and I keep everything to myself because I believe that people don't care about me. I know now that this is a response to my past experiences and I'm trying to be better but it's so hard. Because letting yourself feel again is scarier than losing people.","Before I went through my trauma, I cared about every little thing people said or thought about me.

163,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I was severely abused by a friend and ex relative. During Covid, I was in a bad place and was 17 still living at home. I was abused sexually, mentally and physically by this guy we will call A. My mom knew it was going on, and she would let him in the house when I wouldn't text him back and he even tried kicking in my door when I locked myself in to keep him away from me. Nothing was ever done. I was always screamed at about my pill addiction (which he started) and weed smoking but he was always the issue. I sent myself to a mental institution in a desperate attempt to get away. I didn't until I finally had enough saved to move out. That's when I met my neighbor who became my boyfriend who saved me. He is my everything. I owe him the world. My sister is now stuck in an abusive relationship. She left him once, and my mother screamed at her and called her stupid. He's not a good kid. He acts like it, but my sister has told me and my boyfriend the truth. He's sexually abused her, hurt her, and talks down to her in front of everyone. My boyfriend has tried talking sense into my family, but it never works. I'm so scared for her, that he will do something before she can truly get away. She doesn't understand what is happening. She was herself again when they broke up. Now that they're back together, there's no life in her voice, no light in her eyes. She never smiles. I miss my baby sister, the funny one who had me in tears on the floor. We've offered her a room in our house, but she doesn't want to leave the family animals behind. I feel helpless.","I was severely abused by a friend and ex relative. During Covid, I was in a bad place and was 17 still living at home.

My mom knew it was going on, and she would let him in the house when I wouldn't text him back and he even tried kicking in my door when I locked myself in to keep him away from me. Nothing was ever done. I was always screamed at about my pill addiction (which he started) and weed smoking but he was always the issue. <br><br>I sent myself to a mental institution in a desperate attempt to get away. I didn't until I finally had enough saved to move out. That's when I met my neighbor who became my boyfriend who saved me. He is my everything. I owe him the world. <br><br>My sister is now stuck in an abusive relationship. She left him once, and my mother screamed at her and called her stupid. He's not a good kid. He acts like it, but my sister has told me and my boyfriend the truth. He's sexually abused her, hurt her, and talks down to her in front of everyone. My boyfriend has tried talking sense into my family, but it never works. <br><br>I'm so scared for her, that he will do something before she can truly get away. She doesn't understand what is happening. She was herself again when they broke up. Now that they're back together, there's no life in her voice, no light in her eyes. She never smiles. <br><br>I miss my baby sister, the funny one who had me in tears on the floor. We've offered her a room in our house, but she doesn't want to leave the family animals behind. I feel helpless.",,"[0.006490796, 0.051789187, -0.024925275, -0.047387276, 0.03173257, 0.030884415, -0.010880211, -0.06530834, 0.030232219, -0.035277475, 0.015206071, -0.03991464, -0.035627287,

164,Reddit-Off My Chest,"All these backhanded compliments like ""wow you look good for 30"" need to go. Nobody ever says things like ""wow you look good for 23"". Why? Because it's expected that you will look good at 23. But apparently as the clock strikes midnight and you turn 30, you are supposed to turn into a rotten pumpkin like that carriage in the Cinderella cartoon. We don't live in 1840 anymore. People don't age that quickly and drastically anymore! You are supposed to look young at 30! Because you ARE young at 30. Yet every time I see a beautiful 30-year-old woman post a selfie there are always people in the comments acting like they are so surprised she looks good cause of course she is supposed to look like a wrinkly grandma. We can't say the rational part of the brain isn't fully developed until age 25 and at the same time act like you get old once you turn 30. Are you saying that I only had 5 years of my life to enjoy the time when I was fully developed but not old yet? Sounds pretty unfair if you ask me. If you want to compliment a person, just say ""you look good"". Don't say ""you look good for 30"" just the same way you wouldn't say ""you're funny for a woman"".","All these backhanded compliments like ""wow you look good for 30"" need to go.

Ive seen numerous comments about how anything fun doesnt appeal to 30+ year olds which has been proven in my eyes several times to be bullshit. 30 is not too old to be single, enjoying city life, owning a fun car, going out, working a fun job, etc. despite the societal expectation. Im not dictating people life choices, but what Im saying is yes people should never feel like they need to give up whats enjoyable in their life in the name of turning 30.'}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-10-04', 'submission_id': 'xveare', 'body': ""Were you ever young?It's in the nature of youth to say such things and those that are more mature say it because it's true""}, {'score': '1', 'created_utc': '2022-10-04', 'submission_id': 'xveare', 'body': ""People don't age that quickly and drastically anymore.

166,Reddit-Off My Chest,"My mom died 10 years ago. October 1st, 2012. And I didn't even remember the anniversary. I was really young when she died of breast cancer. My step mom has been in my life for longer than my bio mom was. I call my step mom mom. When people ask about my parents, she's mom. I only ever mention bio mom when I need to. It doesn't feel like she was even real. I was so young. I've basically forgotten her. People tell me all these things about her, and it feels like I'm hearing about a stranger. I just smile and nod because what else can I do? People always tell me they're sorry for my loss, but I feel like they shouldn't be. It doesnt feel like my loss. It almost feels like I'm in a video game and her death took place before the events of the game. I know it happened, but I barely remember anything. Does that make me a bad child? She gave so much for me, wanted to be with me until the very end, and I can barely remember any of it. I feel like a terrible person for forgetting the anniversary, for forgetting her.","My mom died 10 years ago. October 1st, 2012.

168,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I'm currently navigating date 6 with a lady who is in an open style relationship, not the traditional hook up type, but essentially she can have relationships outside her relationship. I went into it being extremely guarded. I guess I am still guarded. We are both getting strong feelings for each other. She always tells me she misses me and wishes she was with me. That she has never felt this way about dating someone. Maybe part of that is down to the fact that I'm the first man she has dated since they opened their relationship.  I couldn't stop thinking of her after our first time together. We have a lot in common. We make each other laugh. I'm pretty scared that we have both fallen in love with each other. Without saying the word or declaring the fact. I'm glad if we have. I remind myself it could be over any moment. Maybe in a different life, we'd be together.","I'm currently navigating date 6 with a lady who is in an open style relationship, not the traditional hook up type, but essentially she can have relationships outside her relationship.

170,Reddit-Off My Chest,So there's this guy in our friend group (7 girls 8 guys) and 3 people in this group (including me) like this guy and guess who ends up dating him? The one girl in our friend group that already had a boyfriend. She's dated (now) 3 guys in the past month lasting from a week to just over a week. I'm worried about her mental health and I think dating so many people isn't doing her any good but also we ALL liked him and she was talking about how much she hated him and how ugly he was the day before but then she snaps me wearing his hoodie. I don't know what to do.,So there's this guy in our friend group (7 girls 8 guys) and 3 people in this group (including me) like this guy and guess who ends up dating him?

171,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I went out to dinner today with my mum, my brother and his wife. My mum mentioned how grandma nearly died yesterday. Grandma lives in China and she has dementia. She was missing yesterday night and they found her wedged between a harbour and a ship. All wet, cold and injured. My mum was clearly upset but was staying strong. She said how grandma is growing old and that she doesn't remember things anymore. At this moment, my brother said my mum repeated it 4 times already. I was annoyed when he said that because of his lack of empathy. Afterwards, when my mum is finally done talking about grandma, my brother said to me and his wife in English. They should just euthanise grandma since she's so old and that she doesn't even remember who she is. I was really annoyed when he said that because of the timing. This event is still so raw. My mum is upset and I'm upset about it. Anyways, afterwards, my mum then asked me what happened (she doesn't understand English). I told her oh my brother said to euthanise grandma. My mum got angry at my brother. My brother then started telling me off for telling my mother about. I then argued with my brother about how he's saying this stuff to get a reaction and to have your opinion rather than actually caring about mum. My brother has always been like that. If we watch a documentary of kids starving, he'll say something like ""Well, I don't care about them because it's not me"". If we were watching something about how animals are getting killed for their skin, he'll say stuff like ""mass extinction happens all the time!"". Like he say these stuff to be witty. Anyways, he then started arguing with my mum about how he's right, saying stuff like you're stupid and stuff. My mum said grandma still wants to live. They're still arguing. What I'm mad about is the fact that my brother clearly wants to be right rather than actually caring about his family like he claims he is.","I went out to dinner today with my mum, my brother and his wife.

172,Reddit-Off My Chest," Battling a debt-ridden business through COVID, a recent divorce (I left my abuser) and spending endless spare times in and out of the hospital with my child, no sleep, no days off, I've felt like I've been through a lot with no help. I went on one of those dating apps and found a girl that I got along well with. At her house we sat all night drinking during a weeknight, singing, dancing like idiots. We calmed down and just embraced each other. She didn't know my story and softly says to me, you look tired. She knew my struggles without even knowing. She could see past the laughs and jokes and massaged my head while I just sat there with my eyes closed. She opened up to me about her problems that she couldn't tell anyone else in the world and I shared mine with her. It's crazy how transparent we are with complete strangers. I'll never forget those words she said, because I could tell she was genuinely worried for me. I don't know why but it's stuck with me ever since."," Battling a debt-ridden business through COVID, a recent divorce (I left my abuser) and spending endless spare times in and out of the hospital with my child, no sleep, no days off, I've felt like I've been through a lot with no help. <br><br>I went on one of those dating apps and found a girl that I got along well with.

175,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I'm a 1st year college student now and it's been weeks since the classes started. I'm anxious because my classmates seem to know a LOT more than what I expected. I have ZERO friends (I tried to socialize but the vibe isn't there). It gets so lonely at lunch, I don't know how it'll pan out for me for the next 3 years of college. I can't even cry because I feel so ungrateful for the equipments and support my parents are giving me, I often feel like this is not my life to live in. Like, someone out there deserves this life more than me. I guess I hate myself somehow for not excelling in academics. I need someone but I don't know who I need.","I'm a 1st year college student now and it's been weeks since the classes started.

176,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I love someone who doesn't love me. We are both in high school, but different ones. We met in 8th grade, and at first I just thought she was a shy but nice girl, but I got to know her and we became best friends. We helped each other through tough times and I started to love her. We were very close and I thought she might like me too. I told her at the end of the year online because I was too scared to say it to her face. She said she just loved me as her best friend, nothing more. And since then a combination of that and moving to different high schools and we have stopped talking much. I love her so much and have never felt like this for anyone. But she's such a good person who doesn't know it, and is so beautiful on the inside. I want to be with her for the rest of my life but she doesn't want me. I don't know what to do. I love her so much, I want to be with her and hold hands and just coexist with her, but we never talk, we go months without speaking and when we talk it's just chatter, not like the actual convos we used to have. I can tell I messed it up by telling her, and now what we had is ruined.","I love someone who doesn't love me. We are both in high school, but different ones.

177,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I had a childhood that pretty badly messed up a lot of things. Then as an adult my first serious relationship was abusive, my second was chaotic and my third I ended out of a misplaced self preservation instinct during the worst time of my life. Then just as I was circling the drain I met someone. They reignited my drive to do the things I love and make the best of myself. To put it simply they made me want to be alive again. Every day became exciting, not the same slog I'd been trying to push through for so long, but just complete wonder. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it just built and got better and better. A few moments with them stand out as the happiest of my life. But eventually things fell apart in stages, ending with me seeing a side of them I never knew was there. Something that touched on some very difficult things in my past and made me feel like everything had been a lie. Some very cruel things were said using vulnerabilities I had opened up to them about over years that no one else knew. Now as I've been trying to move on from that I've come up on another issue. I just can't seem to date anymore. It was before Covid that I met them so for a while I brushed this off as just being out of practice but I realised that wasn't the problem. I have no problem getting dates, my problem is I just can't summon the interest in anyone I meet in a dating context. People I meet randomly who I've had a flicker of interest in all end up being taken and I end up feeling relieved more than disappointed. I can't even have casual encounters because I just keep thinking about that person and I can never go through with it even when I've got people over specifically for that. I feel trapped and so very lonely. Despite everything I still find it impossible to imagine being with anyone who isn't them. Even though I really want a relationship, I want to love and be loved but I don't know how to do that anymore. I'm exhausted.","I had a childhood that pretty badly messed up a lot of things.

They reignited my drive to do the things I love and make the best of myself. To put it simply they made me want to be alive again. Every day became exciting, not the same slog I'd been trying to push through for so long, but just complete wonder. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it just built and got better and better. A few moments with them stand out as the happiest of my life. <br><br>But eventually things fell apart in stages, ending with me seeing a side of them I never knew was there. Something that touched on some very difficult things in my past and made me feel like everything had been a lie. Some very cruel things were said using vulnerabilities I had opened up to them about over years that no one else knew. <br><br>Now as I've been trying to move on from that I've come up on another issue. I just can't seem to date anymore. It was before Covid that I met them so for a while I brushed this off as just being out of practice but I realised that wasn't the problem. I have no problem getting dates, my problem is I just can't summon the interest in anyone I meet in a dating context. People I meet randomly who I've had a flicker of interest in all end up being taken and I end up feeling relieved more than disappointed. <br><br>I can't even have casual encounters because I just keep thinking about that person and I can never go through with it even when I've got people over specifically for that. I feel trapped and so very lonely. Despite everything I still find it impossible to imagine being with anyone who isn't them. <br><br>Even though I really want a relationship, I want to love and be loved but I don't know how to do that anymore.

178,Reddit-Off My Chest,"I used to hate my dad with a certain passion that now I can only describe as ignorantly hating someone. But now I love him more than I thought I ever would. The only thing I have to thank for this is football and sports as a whole. I'm 18 and for the years between 2015 and 2019 I hated my dad. I didn't want to hear his voice or even see him. But when I got into high school and played for my school's football team and he showed up to my first game because my older sister told him I was playing I started feeling happier than I thought I'd ever be and felt ashamed for the first time in my life. But it wasn't just the first game. It was one after the other. He missed the ones that were like an hour drive from our town but he was there for almost every one of them. I'll never forget the look in his eyes when he hugged me tighter than I'd ever felt him hug me and heard that deep bellow in his voice that I once thought annoying. I heard the words, ""Son, I'll never not be proud of you"" after we had lost our game ending season. But he didn't care that we lost. He cared that I had worked. I never felt very confident during that first year but just hearing him tell me that made me happier than I'd ever been. It gave me this sense of pride that I'd never felt. My dad changed my life by being there. He changed my life by making me realize that his past doesn't define who he is now. He made me change more than I thought I could.","I used to hate my dad with a certain passion that now I can only describe as ignorantly hating someone.

I interviewed yesterday and was on pins and needles waiting to hear back from them. I got the offer about an hour ago! Things are going so well for me right now, and this was a stepping stone I needed to get to a stable enough place to go back to school and now I can start working towards that.","I applied to a job at a place I've been a customer for about 5 years.

181,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"There are songs that are generally motivational/moving/happy. The ones that give you a confidence boost or tell you it's going to be okay. Basically the ones that relate to mental health overall. Those songs used to make me cry and I never understood why, because they're supposed to be motivating. I went through something really bad recently and that event kinda opened my eyes a bit, helped me learn to love myself, and helped me see things clearer. Now I'm smiling as I listen to these songs because I know I've achieved the positivity the songs promote. And I now realize I used to cry listening to them because I was hoping for a positivity I didn't have. Loving yourself is a core part of self care and good mental health.","There are songs that are generally motivational/moving/happy.

182,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I know its not the coolest of hobbies but I LOVE watching movies, learning about who made them and what other works they have, how they were made, and looking for Easter eggs. My best friend who also loves movies as much as I do lives almost a thousand miles and two states away so I can't go and see movies with her anymore. Recently my husband bought me the unlimited Regal movie app that allows me to see as many movies as I want for free, and since today is my only day off this week, I'm taking myself out to a movie date! My social anxiety keeps me from going to some places, but a dark movie theater where I can mow down on popcorn that I can smother with candy AND I don't have to share? Yes please and thank you. I can't wait for 2:50.","I know its not the coolest of hobbies but I LOVE watching movies, learning about who made them and what other works they have, how they were made, and looking for Easter eggs. <br><br>My best friend who also loves movies as much as I do lives almost a thousand miles and two states away so I can't go and see movies with her anymore. <br><br>Recently my husband bought me the unlimited Regal movie app that allows me to see as many movies as I want for free, and since today is my only day off this week, I'm taking myself out to a movie date! <br><br>My social anxiety keeps me from going to some places, but a dark movie theater where I can mow down on popcorn that I can smother with candy AND I don't have to share?

183,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I'm transgender, and a failed artist. I've never been abused but I didn't come from a happy home. For the longest time in my life, I was deeply unhappy. I was in a loop, I couldn't get a surgery to fix something that made my body repulsive to me because the doctors thought I was too depressed to endure it, and I was depressed because I was repulsed. I'd given up ever finding true love or a job I could endure. I had accepted nobody would want someone like me, either to love them or work for them. The things I could offer were simply not enough. Today I woke up, bandages on my chest, with hands working well enough to draw. Surgery I had been fighting for for 15 years, and I finally had it, I'm free! As soon as I got my phone back, I sent the message to my boyfriend, the sweetest love of my life who is my sun and moonlight and my northern star, that everything went so great, I don't feel at all as bad as I was told that this would feel. And I could draw, as I got my sketchbook back. I drew a little comic to let my online followers know that it was great, I can draw! I drew a comic about my relationship with my partner, that is how much I adore him, and people like them, they can relate with their own boyfriends, girlfriends and love of their life. Once I can get to my locker to get headphones, I'm going to relax for the rest of the evening, watching videos of gold leaf application and other art piece restoration, art which I love and only recently realised I could study as a career! I just startled the nurse who was about to bring me a cup of coffee, and I had to reassure her I'm just crying tears of joy.","I'm transgender, and a failed artist.

184,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I'm a first year college student and I was so anxious about finals and stressed out over studying. There were nights I was staying up until 2 AM studying for my tests and reading things. I had no idea what to expect for finals week except what I had seen online and how my friends who are upperclassmen described it. Finals were simultaneously what I was and wasn't expecting. I knew they would be challenging given how my midterms were, but I wasn't expecting the whole ordeal to be so stressful, especially the week prior to finals. There were times I considered giving up and dropping out I was so stressed out! But thanks to the awesome support team that I have on campus and at home, I was able to push through it all and now I'm finally done! It feels so good to be able to relax and enjoy the holidays with my family! I can't wait to catch up with my old friends!","I'm a first year college student and I was so anxious about finals and stressed out over studying.

185,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"Someone is always pregnant in the massive extended family I have. My sister announced she's due New Year's Eve, then I just got word that two of my cousins are also expecting in February! I don't really like kids that much but the ones in my family are the exception. I'm excited to have a little nephew and more little baby cousins running around, especially so close in age. My family is big on cousins being raised together so it's always better when they're the same or close to the same age. I, for instance, have a cousin that's 11 months my senior. We grew up together and were play buddies for years. I'm just happy that my family's relationships and marriages are good enough that they're having kids even in the midst of a global pandemic and everything else going on. Makes me feel hopeful and optimistic for the future.","Someone is always pregnant in the massive extended family I have.

186,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I checked my credit score and it was over 800! Just a few months ago I was overwhelmed and struggling with debt. My credit score was between 575 and 625, which made me really depressed and I felt pretty worthless. I've been working on it and I finally qualified for a personal loan for the remainder of the debt. I knew my score would improve, but didn't think it would be quite this much! It was SUCH an amazing feeling/surprise to see those little numbers pop up on the computer screen. In addition, I was finally able to pay the back registration for my truck and can drive it again! It's so wonderful to finally feel like I'm in control again!","I checked my credit score and it was over 800! Just a few months ago I was overwhelmed and struggling with debt.

187,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"Five years ago today I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 28. It was completely unexpected. I have no family history of it, but my pancreas just quit on me and suddenly I was dependent on insulin. I went to the hospital after days of extreme fatigue and vomiting. The doctors told me I was experiencing Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and that based on my numbers, it was a miracle I was still conscious. They told me if I hadn't come to the emergency room when I did, I would have been dead within days. It's been a lot of work to keep myself alive but I'm very grateful to still be here!","Five years ago today I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 28. It was completely unexpected.

189,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"This morning, I found out I am going to my first public school, which is within a biking distance from my house. After finding this out, I discover that tomorrow, I must awaken in the morning 1 hour earlier than usual as to prepare for my day because I am getting contacts tomorrow, and my glasses come in next week. I will finally be able to see! After that whole thing, I felt amazing and decided to get stuff done, and I believe I was quite productive. After that, I rode my bicycle and got to pet 10 dogs They were all very happy to sniff me and lick me, and I was very happy to scratch behind their ears and give them my complete attention. After petting the 6th fur angel, I found a really cool looking tree that looked like an umbrella, but completely natural, dome shape and all. I sat under said tree and became very happy. On my way home, I did not have issues riding up the extremely steep hill which I normally ride down, and made it home, where I cooked some rice, did more school work, and was snuggled by my dog. All in all, I hope tomorrow is just as great, because I am now in a positive mood and do not ever want the happiness to end!","This morning, I found out I am going to my first public school, which is within a biking distance from my house.

190,Reddit-Today I Am Happy," Outside of a job/income, I've got everything I could want. A little apartment with the love of my life with flowers on the windowsill, and plans to tidy up and furnish the place. None of the things that I dreaded from my old homes have followed me here. Everything's pleasant and peaceful, I can trust that the person I want to make happy in life also wants me to be happy. We do things together to make ourselves a nice home. There's no bitterness or spite or taking bad moods out to anyone. He's just as interested as I am about making a nice home we'll both enjoy. It's become a habit for both of us to just go express affection as a sign of being in a good mood, for something completely unrelated. The apartment is small so I can stop to kiss him on my way to the fridge and back, we can kiss while hanging up laundry, and hold hands while running boring errands and getting groceries. I can make him laugh. Today he laid down on the bed for a while to get a break from sitting while gaming. So I went to kiss him, and as I got up, I took off his left sock and took it with me. He was so baffled that I'd do something like that for literally no reason that he started laughing, and his laughter is sunshine. Today we're taking my old, broken table to recycling. It was replaced by the nice, prettier, sturdy table his parents bought for us. The apartment we share together is still a chaotic mess, but it is the mess that I want to be in. Life is nice."," Outside of a job/income, I've got everything I could want. A little apartment with the love of my life with flowers on the windowsill, and plans to tidy up and furnish the place.

191,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I ruptured my ACL and had to have surgery. The initial injury and surgery recovery has been so draining. I'm still sore and my leg is weak, but I'm in the least amount of pain that I have been in two weeks. I'm finally able to walk around the house without a brace. Things are looking up. On top of everything, I haven't been able to take my dog on walks or play fetch like we used to. Loved ones have been coming over to help, but all I've been able to do lately is offer cuddles, which is great, but seeing how happy she was today when I was finally able to play with her on the couch was everything.","I ruptured my ACL and had to have surgery.

192,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I listen to this podcast called Were You Raised By Wolves?. It's all etiquette, questions and how to handle tough situations gracefully and properly. I had a situation worthy of some input so I emailed them last week. They got back to me yesterday with the kindest email and told me my question would be included in a future episode. It was actually written by one of the hosts, not a form email and it was so lovely. I included some sloth facts for Leah (one of the hosts) in my original email and Nick (another host) actually thanked me for them and told me Leah loved them. I've been under a lot of stress lately, work and therapy and a death in the family, so that small bit of kindness was almost too much for me.

193,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I just finished a book! It was short, but I actually enjoyed it! Whenever I had to read a book in school, any book, I hated it. I kept losing track of where we were in class readings. I never actually wanted to participate. Today, it felt like the opposite of all that stuff! My reading comprehension can still be all over the place sometimes (I have ADHD), but it wasn't hard to focus. Also, it feels less isolating to read a book by yourself. Simply spending time to read with anyone can make you feel more connected and less isolated!","I just finished a book! It was short, but I actually enjoyed it!

194,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I socialized with one of the most extroverted, sociable, boisterous guys in our school and I am the opposite of him. I'm reserved, inquisitive, and hot-headed. I was astonished how he is an introspective guy which I did not expect. He has helped me with a lot of things and also helped me in promoting my channel. We have the same taste in terms of memes and he even helped me with interacting with his friends who were pretty cool and sweet. All this was completely unexpected for me as I never saw it coming and I was determined that I would go out of my comfort zone socially and I succeeded and I'm very proud of it.","I socialized with one of the most extroverted, sociable, boisterous guys in our school and I am the opposite of him.

195,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I was sitting on my back porch this morning and I realized that despite lock downs and quarantine, I have had a pretty great summer. I was productive by taking a summer course (I did well and loved the material and professor), working a job, and coordinating my club activities by video-calling people throughout the summer. I grew some vegetable plants to eat and some plants to sell, I picked up some new skills like learning Morse code and hobbies like chess, and I've been dedicated to working on my mental health through talk therapy and mindfulness meditation. Since it's the end of summer, I can look back now at all my hard work and all the fun I had despite not spending a lot of it with people and I can say that my confidence has increased and my anxiety overall has decreased. I'm looking forward to things getting better in the future and interacting with others with a new sense of self! I couldn't be happier!","I was sitting on my back porch this morning and I realized that despite lock downs and quarantine, I have had a pretty great summer.

196,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"This week started off as incredibly difficult, and I suffered one of the most severe panic attacks I've experienced in several months. However I was shown some exceptional kindness earlier this week, and that motivated me to do something positive. So, I've been needing a place to store my laptop and keyboard that also doubles as something I can work at. I turned a 6 feet piece of wood in to a shelf/desk combo complete with notches for cable management. It's not great, but I'm happy to have done something productive and positive. Hopefully working on music will go more smoothly if I feel like I'm actually at a work station and not just lying sprawled on my bed.","This week started off as incredibly difficult, and I suffered one of the most severe panic attacks I've experienced in several months.

198,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"Been crushing on a coworker for a while now. She's new, very down to earth and we share some common interests (horror movies, music, sarcasm). We both got each other gifts and she agreed to hang out and partake in our gifts either Thursday or Friday this week. She's a really cool young lady and I'm so excited to use this time to get to know her more. My boyfriend has been encouraging me to find a girlfriend for a while (we've been poly in the past and he's really supportive of it) but I didn't really find the right person until now. Even if we just end up as friends I'm happy and excited that this is moving forward. She's a person I really want to have in my life and I can't wait to have some one on one time to discover more about her.","Been crushing on a coworker for a while now.

199,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I was feeling a little down but I decided I would pick up my ukulele and learn a song. I learned Hallelujah, the Jeff Buckley version a while ago, and had forgotten it so I started with that. I played the same melody over and over again and it just made me appreciate how beautiful music is. I'm feeling a lot better now. Music can bring so much joy and show beautiful harmony in a world full of so much chaos.","I was feeling a little down but I decided I would pick up my ukulele and learn a song.

201,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I am in a long distance relationship but I am separated from my significant other by a few hours. I am a nurse at a great hospital but quite frankly, my management. I have woken up dreading going to work for so long that it's my normal. These people have sucked the joy out of what I so passionately love to do. I did try to wait it out to see if things would get better over time, but with no success. We've been together for less than a year but have talked about closing the gap. I've met his family and friends and vice versa. Nothing but good things from both sides. This guy I am sure with every cell in my body that we're destined to be together. I'm gonna husband that man someday. I would be the moving party between the both of us and I'm absolutely okay with that. I had updated my resume and sent some applications out last week, not expecting to hear anything from anyone until this week. I have an interview set for Friday morning and if all goes well, I will accept a position in my significant other's town doing what I love to do! And that means we can finally start our lives together. And that gives me so much hope for the future.","I am in a long distance relationship but I am separated from my significant other by a few hours.

202,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"My trampoline is in my backyard but our house is situated on the corner of the street so people can see me (a 20 year old hermit) jumping on a trampoline while listening to music, trying to get extra sunlight. I thought I would look funny being older and all and some neighbors once looked at me funny simply for carrying a shovel across the yard so I was very anxious at first. But after listening to a YouTube video about Cynicism (I always listen to philosophy when I'm feeling extremely sad or anxious) I decided to do it anyway since the benefits would outweigh the negative perspective I would probably get. And I'm glad I did. It's hard doing simple stuff for me and I was glad I was able to overcome something today.","My trampoline is in my backyard but our house is situated on the corner of the street so people can see me (a 20 year old hermit) jumping on a trampoline while listening to music, trying to get extra sunlight. <br><br>I thought I would look funny being older and all and some neighbors once looked at me funny simply for carrying a shovel across the yard so I was very anxious at first. <br><br>But after listening to a YouTube video about Cynicism (I always listen to philosophy when I'm feeling extremely sad or anxious) I decided to do it anyway since the benefits would outweigh the negative perspective I would probably get. <br><br>And I'm glad I did.

Man. I'm 27 and I'd love to do that more and am sure those same friends would enjoy the same thing if we had access to a trampoline. I'm so envious.

203,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I grew up playing an all-girls' sport. I never was really friends with the other girls because they were always talking about boys and makeup and drama while I was always more focused on my grades, college, or reading. I didn't dislike any of them, just always felt out of the loop and disconnected. I was homeschooled so my only interaction with other people my age was these eight or so girls who hung out all the time and never invited me. They weren't always trying to be mean but they were always closer with each other because they shared common interests. I would try to not let it get to me, but it always hurt that everyone seemed to always have someone to talk to and I had nobody. My mom always told me I would find my group eventually and it would just make the friendship that much more valuable. Well, I finally found my group. It's a strange friend group but I feel connected. And on top of that, I actually have a best friend! I started a new sport last year and found I had a lot more in common with my training partners. Granted, most of them are a good ten to twenty years older than I am but we're all really close and talk a lot. I also have someone to call my best friend! I never would have imagined someone like her actually being friends with me. She likes dressing up and going out, is extroverted, optimistic, a go with the flow kind of person, and isn't super competitive. I, on the other hand, hate shopping/dressing up, view myself as a nerd, am a little more negative, feel the need to plan everything down to the minute, and am super competitive to the point where I spend all my free time training. She also is a very touchy-feely person, whereas I am not so much. Recently, we became very close to the point where she will sometimes refuse to go places with the rest of the friend group if I'm not able to go because she feels closer to me than the others. The other day, she mentioned that she got me something small for my birthday and I am so happy. She actually remembered my birthday after I only mentioned it once and, as if just remembering it weren't enough, felt the need to get me something. I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found someone who values me as a person and the friendship doesn't feel one sided!","I grew up playing an all-girls' sport.

204,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I have never really been able to emotionally bond with my kid. Between post-natal depression and all my weird mental health issues, I've struggled to bond with my kid. But tonight we hung out and played Among Us and talked a lot. She's now 15, so she's at a weird point in her life, but she told me everything, about her boyfriend and her friends. She confided in me and promised me to tell me when she's having sex or when she wants to try drugs, and I feel happy that she trusts me to tell me these things. It's a weird thing to be happy about, but I am, and it makes me feel like a good mum for once.","I have never really been able to emotionally bond with my kid.

205,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"Last week I broke 2 of my bras and only had my backup one left. Even though it was unplanned I was able to afford 2 new bras. I also broke a pair of shoes last week, the insole came out and wouldn't go in again. It was a bad week for my clothing. I was able to buy insoles and good ones, not just the dollar store ones. I am so excited to be wearing clothes that fit properly and shoes that don't hurt my feet.","Last week I broke 2 of my bras and only had my backup one left.

206,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I just talked to my friend. He's someone I had a crush on for years way back from high school. We started talking again lately after about 3 years of not talking and it's been great. He has always been one with a great mind and lots of insight on life - part of the reason why I loved him back then. He said he has no problem observing people and understanding them, but he has difficulty looking back into himself, and I was a mirror that helped him do that. He appreciated it a lot. And I was over the moon when he said that. He's probably the only one I can hold a conversation through text with for hours.","I just talked to my friend.

207,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I always have felt behind in my life compared to my friends and other people I know. I'm 17 and I can't drive, I've never had a boyfriend, and I don't know what my plans are for the future. I felt so bad, like I was lesser than. But this summer I got a job. I worked six days a week, like 60 hours a week. I was just going through the motions. And here I am today, checking my bank account for the first time, and I have a balance of $7, 636.41. I can't believe I earned that! It feels SO good! None of my friends have jobs, and they always have to ask their parents for money, but here I am with this hefty loft! And then also today, I finally got confirmation that I just got another job. Today is going so well! I feel like I'm really able to conquer the world and save money, and that when I move out next year, I'll know what to do. I can finally afford driving school, and I may not have any big plans, but now I'm going to get my CNA training with the Red Cross, because a woman I know offered me a job to be her in-house CNA if I get training. And after I get experience there I can try for this healthcare agency, and I'll be able to make a higher wage traveling between locations, and I can pick what days I work and what shifts or if I even want to work at all that week. Things are finally starting to piece together. Everything feels so clear, and right. Like I have a path to go down now, and I'm doing it ALL BY MYSELF! Nobody handed anything to me, nobody helped me with this. I DID THIS!! I just feel so proud and hopefully I can start saving for a car or I'll have to figure out how loans work.","I always have felt behind in my life compared to my friends and other people I know.

208,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I am a medical technology student and we are studying phlebotomy this semester. My hometown is in a province but I moved to the city to study college. I don't have friends in the city and university. I also live alone. My classmates were able to practice drawing blood from their friends and roommates. I cannot practice because I do not have anyone to practice with. I was able to talk with 4 of my classmates but they have already known each other for years so I'm a bit left out of the group. Earlier was our practical in drawing blood. It's like a demo and it's also graded. I was nervous but I remained calm. My partner drew blood from me first and she was shaking out of nervousness! Fortunately, she was able to draw blood from me. When I was going to draw blood from her, I was surprisingly calm. I was not shaking. At first, I was not able to get the blood so I moved the needle slightly and saw the backflow of blood! I was so happy! It was the first time I drew blood! Although, my professor deducted points because I did not fill up my syringe even though I could. But still, I'm very happy because I was able to draw blood without practice and only watching my classmates do it. If I told this to my mom, she will also be very happy!","I am a medical technology student and we are studying phlebotomy this semester.

209,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I suffer from major depressive disorder (and about half a dozen other DSM-V diagnoses) and I hesitated for years to get another pet because I was worried I couldn't provide the kind of care and attention they need and deserve. Then the pandemic came. With the freedom of being fortunate enough to work from home, I felt like I had a choice to either use my newfound free time to accelerate my self-destruction through isolation and substance abuse (which I absolutely did for the first few months of quarantine) or find a way to actually improve my life -- and that's what I've done my best to work toward for the last year. I moved out of my parents' house at an embarrassingly late age and bought one of my own, something I'm incredibly proud of and was very lucky to have been able to do. I got back into therapy and decided to try some new medications with as much patience as I could muster. I started taking a bit better care of myself physically and spending more time around people, especially my handful of good friends. Feeling better about myself than I have in a while, I finally ran out of excuses not to go through with the adoption and went to the local humane society. I met a dozen or so dogs but there was only one I felt an immediate connection to and I took her home that day. She was nervous at first in her new environment and didn't even want to join me on the couch but, after a couple days of realizing I wouldn't ever leave her, she was already sleeping on my lap. She follows me everywhere and loves to play and cuddle. She had a play date with a friend's dog yesterday and she had so much fun that she's still exhausted. Plus she gets me moving which I desperately needed! As a depressed person who also feels like he can give a rescue a happy life, I'm confident it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I am genuinely happy for the first time in at least a decade when I'm around her and worry constantly when I occasionally can't be. I can't wait to travel again now that this viral nightmare has finally began to wind down and I'm so looking forward to taking her with me.","I suffer from major depressive disorder (and about half a dozen other DSM-V diagnoses) and I hesitated for years to get another pet because I was worried I couldn't provide the kind of care and attention they need and deserve. <br><br>Then the pandemic came. With the freedom of being fortunate enough to work from home, I felt like I had a choice to either use my newfound free time to accelerate my self-destruction through isolation and substance abuse (which I absolutely did for the first few months of quarantine) or find a way to actually improve my life -- and that's what I've done my best to work toward for the last year. <br><br>I moved out of my parents' house at an embarrassingly late age and bought one of my own, something I'm incredibly proud of and was very lucky to have been able to do. I got back into therapy and decided to try some new medications with as much patience as I could muster. I started taking a bit better care of myself physically and spending more time around people, especially my handful of good friends. <br><br>Feeling better about myself than I have in a while, I finally ran out of excuses not to go through with the adoption and went to the local humane society. I met a dozen or so dogs but there was only one I felt an immediate connection to and I took her home that day. <br><br>She was nervous at first in her new environment and didn't even want to join me on the couch but, after a couple days of realizing I wouldn't ever leave her, she was already sleeping on my lap. She follows me everywhere and loves to play and cuddle. She had a play date with a friend's dog yesterday and she had so much fun that she's still exhausted. Plus she gets me moving which I desperately needed! <br><br>As a depressed person who also feels like he can give a rescue a happy life, I'm confident it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I am genuinely happy for the first time in at least a decade when I'm around her and worry constantly when I occasionally can't be. <br><br>I can't wait to travel again now that this viral nightmare has finally began to wind down and I'm so looking forward to taking her with me.","[{'score': '3', 'created_utc': '2021-06-08', 'submission_id': 'nuyctx', 'body': ""Congratulations! You did a brave thing. Yes, it is sad (but unsurprising) to see stories of pets being returned/abandoned as the pandemic winds down. People keep on underestimating how much care and attention pets require.

210,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"A month ago I bought a pair of jeans online that I thought were my size but when I got them they were too small and I realized I gained a lot more weight than I thought I did. Not fitting into these jeans and my doctor telling me I was obese is what made me realize that I needed to lose weight. Now I can finally fit into these jeans comfortably. At the time, I could barely button them up. Today I finally fit into them. This made me happy because I've been trying to lose weight for a while now, and this is the longest I've gone without binging or quitting. I know it's only been a month but I'm proud of myself. I can't wait to be at a healthy weight.","A month ago I bought a pair of jeans online that I thought were my size but when I got them they were too small and I realized I gained a lot more weight than I thought I did.

211,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I am both debilitatingly excited and nervous right now. I have been quite lonely for what feels like most of my entire life, but I was lucky enough to meet this guy in one of my classes a couple of weeks or so ago who is very nice and actually seems to have some sort of interest in me. We've especially been talking more this week, and I was so happy because he asked for my number a couple days ago. Today when we were talking towards the end of class, though, I had mentioned that a couple things I really like are photography and hiking. One thing he asked was about which trail was my favorite, and when I told him, he said he really liked that one too because it was pretty close and he enjoyed going mountain biking there. Eventually, he said that he would love to take me there this weekend, because I had mentioned that I didn't really have any plans. I said that sounded like it would be super fun and that I'd be happy to go with him, and by the end of our chat, he said he would call me later so we could work out our plans. Fast forward to when I was at home, and I was so nervous once again for when he would call me because it's actually our first time talking on the phone and doing something outside of school. When he did call, my heart was practically pounding, but I was able to answer it on time. He's picking me up at 11 in the morning tomorrow, and I think I'm more excited than I've ever been. I wasn't so sure what to make of it, but he actually called it ""our date"" while we were on the phone, so I cannot get that out of my head now. I already have some nice memories from that specific trail we're going on, and it now means even more to me than ever that I'm actually going on my first date ever there. I never would've expected something like this to happen in my life even a month or so ago (especially because I didn't even know him very well at all then), and I thought I would just get through high school being almost completely alone and maybe meet someone special in my adult life if I'm lucky, but I guess things really can get better!","I am both debilitatingly excited and nervous right now.

212,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I'm somewhere on the spectrum of being a hoarder. I have severe hyperempathy for inanimate objects, including clothes, stuffed animals, toys, books, and a lot more. It's close to impossible for me to throw these things away or even donate them. I also have depression and I'm physically disabled, so cleaning is very hard on me and I have very little motivation. I buy things that I don't need and then throw them on one of the piles in my room and forget about them. I hoard yarn, I have so much that I've never used. My room was a death trap. The worst part was a very old extension cord/power strip buried in yarn and general trash. I couldn't see the floor in almost the entire room. I had to wipe my feet off to get in bed because just walking through my room got so much dirt on them. It smelled really bad and there was trash everywhere. It was such a fire hazard. Not even getting into the bugs. Today I finished my final exams and since my ADHD meds hadn't worn off I was really motivated, so I started cleaning my room. I can actually see the floor!! I've found so many things and I feel so much safer because I got all the stuff cleared out from around that power strip. I still have a long way to go, I'm taking a break right now, but I'm so proud of myself. I've filled up three big trash bags and I'm working on a fourth, and I have another bag full of clothes to donate. I'm probably going to crash pretty bad later, but I have tomorrow off work too so it'll be okay. I've been needing to do this for a really long time. It's not going to be perfect but it's a lot safer and I feel a lot better and that's what matters.","I'm somewhere on the spectrum of being a hoarder.

214,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I remember when I first opened my bank account at 16 the first thing my Dad said was 'DONT GET A CREDIT CARD'! Although it was always tempting, I didn't, until I did. I met a girl who at the time I didn't know was kinda rich. When we met I was only making 11,000 a year after taxes. She was making 40,000 after taxes. We decided to go on holiday and even though she offered I couldn't let her pay the bulk of it. So I got a credit card. And we used that as spending money. I got a credit card and my thinking was literally 'maybe owing the bank will encourage me to get better prospects.' Surprisingly enough IT DID. Risky game though. I went to college and used the credit card to pay for it thinking it's gonna be an investment. It was. I still wasn't making much but entry level I was making more than I was when we had met. We've been together 10 years and will have been married for 5 years in May. During these 10 years I've quit smoking and drinking heavily. I still drink but it's like once a month and not everyday like I was when I first met my wife. When my wife told me she was pregnant the first time, my mind went don't let your kids have your debt. And I made my final payment today. I checked my statements and my initial use was 3,000 and over the years between college it amassed to about 7,000. I payed the bank at least 10,000 overall. But it's finally over. I am debt free.","I remember when I first opened my bank account at 16 the first thing my Dad said was 'DONT GET A CREDIT CARD'! Although it was always tempting, I didn't, until I did. I met a girl who at the time I didn't know was kinda rich. When we met I was only making 11,000 a year after taxes. She was making 40,000 after taxes. We decided to go on holiday and even though she offered I couldn't let her pay the bulk of it. So I got a credit card. And we used that as spending money. <br><br>I got a credit card and my thinking was literally 'maybe owing the bank will encourage me to get better prospects.' Surprisingly enough IT DID. Risky game though. I went to college and used the credit card to pay for it thinking it's gonna be an investment. It was. I still wasn't making much but entry level I was making more than I was when we had met. <br><br>We've been together 10 years and will have been married for 5 years in May. During these 10 years I've quit smoking and drinking heavily. I still drink but it's like once a month and not everyday like I was when I first met my wife. <br><br>When my wife told me she was pregnant the first time, my mind went don't let your kids have your debt.

215,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"This morning I went for a run. In the beginning I had to pass several streets. When I approached one of them, a bus driver did not see me and drove past right in front of me. This was in my view completely fine, as I usually just find my way across the street without anybody having to stop. But this bus driver stopped the bus right after he passed me, pulled down the window and apologized for not letting me run by first.

216,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"I work in the event industry and covid did its number on us but restrictions are finally loosened enough for us to do our job the way we used to. Half my body hurts, I'm definitely not getting enough sleep and won't have a day off that I can actually spend on my couch for the next 2 weeks. This sounds bad, but it's exactly what I need right now. Having fun work days with my colleagues, who are equally as crazy as I am, doing a job I enjoy and feeling my sore muscles when I'm back home. My mental health has gotten so much better in the past two weeks. Before that I was touring with a couple of folks who made me feel unwelcome and I constantly felt like no matter what I was doing, it wasn't enough. I did overestimate my skill and took over responsibilities I wasn't ready for, so their frustration is understandable, but it still took its toll on my mental health. Hard work isn't nearly as much fun if it's not appreciated. Luckily I'm back and everything's gotten better. I randomly smile. I want to remember the day when I go to bed instead of hoping I'd forget it soon. I look forward to tomorrow instead of dreading it and I actually feel happy. This hasn't happened in a long time.","I work in the event industry and covid did its number on us but restrictions are finally loosened enough for us to do our job the way we used to.

217,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"My brother studies IT and he got an assigment to make a game. He's been working on it for some time now and every time he does something new or has an issue, he calls me into his room and tells me what he did. I have no clue what he's doing and don't understand much but I sit and listen. There's this method that programmers use when they can't find where the mistake in their code is. They take a rubber duck and go through their code by explaining to it what they did so they find the issue. I'm always joking I'm my brother's rubber duck since I don't do much more than listen. Today he finished his game and asked me to try it out. It was really cool but I saw something odd and asked him why it is that way. He realised he made a mistake and fixed it real quick. Finally, I am more useful than a rubber duck!","My brother studies IT and he got an assigment to make a game.

218,Reddit-Today I Am Happy,"A friend that I was close to died in a car accident a couple weeks ago. I'm feeling crushed emotionally and I know that my sadness has made me seclude myself. I took a few days off from work to grieve my friend. Yesterday, a girl from my office texted me and asked if she could come by. My office had put together a card for me and although we've been teleworking (because of COVID) this girl drove to different coworkers' homes and had them sign the card with notes of support to me. She came by today and gave me the card, gave me a long, tight hug, and to my surprise she kissed my cheek. I've had a crush on this girl for a while but I've been quiet about it as I was dating someone else until recently. Her kissing my cheek wasn't expected, but it made me smile. It does feel good to have people in your corner when you're feeling down. I appreciate it more than I know how to say.","A friend that I was close to died in a car accident a couple weeks ago.

220,Road Trip Narratives,"I'm the president of a sustainable construction company in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I was born in Manhattan and I came to visit my sister, who lives in Santa Fe and I thought, well, I think I'd like to live out here. And so I found a piece of land south of town, really rural, with no electricity at the site. So I set up a solar array, really small with some batteries and an inverter. And I said, I think that I can do this for a living. But I never intended, I never planned this at all, I just sort of fell into it. And it was logical and it was survival honestly, so show initiative. Don't wait for someone to say, do that. Try to figure it out as you're going along to understand the whole spectrum of the project. Because if it's already something that you think you're part way into, or that you may have some passion for, that might be your career, that might be the thing that you wanna do.","I'm the president of a sustainable construction company in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

221,Road Trip Narratives,"The single worst job I ever had was washing dishes at a hospital in Philadelphia. I was the guy who was doing the communicable diseases stuff. So I had to wear the heavy gloves, and that stuff was just nasty. I started working my way up the ladder, reminding myself, well, I could be doing that, which was always very helpful. It helped me to never look down on somebody for what they're doing, because if somebody looked down at me washing those eight patients ' dishes, they would have misjudged me completely. Anybody who tells you that they woke up and were whoever they were, they're kidding you. Everybody gets started somewhere. If somebody figured something out, you can too, because they did the hard part. They figured it out the first time. Don't measure yourself in terms of my gosh, I've got so far to go. Eventually, you get there. Just know that if you keep plugging away, it will work out. I'm a big believer, you do the right things, good things happen.","The single worst job I ever had was washing dishes at a hospital in Philadelphia.

222,Road Trip Narratives,"The expectations on both sides, from my mother and father, were always to do well in school. There was never a question about whether or not I would go to college. It was when I got to college and lost my support and scaffolding system that I completely fell apart. I had been so successful for so long and I could not figure out why I could not pull it together. Because I struggled. Now I understand and know it was my ADHD. I had no clue at the time what it was. I started working in the classroom and the first day in the classroom, I fell in love. What I discovered was preschoolers all to some degree have ADHD. So, we got along fine. They have 10 minute attention spans, so do I, so the activities were cool. It was just the perfect job for me. I was like, why didn't anybody tell me I could do this before? I didn't really get my act together until probably my late 20s or early 30s. I accept that I have challenges and sometimes I'm not gonna do stuff right. Be able to forgive yourself and other people. Move on to the next hurdle because there's always gonna be another hurdle.","The expectations on both sides, from my mother and father, were always to do well in school.

223,Road Trip Narratives,"I interned in a senator's office last year and I just felt too disconnected from everyone. It's hard to feel like you're making a difference for people serving in that capacity. So I came back to my TA who started builders of promise and I was like, government really wasn't my bit. So she offered to have me come work with her nonprofit. I think pretty much anything you do will result in some kind of skill or a way of thinking that's gonna help you later in your life. Just don't be afraid to take those chances. As long as you have the tenacity to stick out the beginnings of everything, everything else falls into place.","I interned in a senator's office last year and I just felt too disconnected from everyone.

224,Road Trip Narratives,"I found rock climbing my freshman year of college. I wanted to stay fit, I want to stay healthy. It was something to distract me from the stresses of school. I got to relax and be focused on myself. I fell in love with it. It's a physical ability, but also having the mental confidence to do these obstacles because they're terrifying, if you first look at them. I felt like this is my chance to show people all around the world that women are stronger than what people make them out to be. Break beyond the grain of we're quiet and timid, and that's who I am. I do well, because I think I have fun with it and it's really just exploring new things and getting scared and feeling uncomfortable which is one of the biggest things. Throwing yourself in a situation where you're feeling uncomfortable and working past that grows you as a person and prepares you for adult life.","I found rock climbing my freshman year of college.

226,Road Trip Narratives,"I ended up getting into plant science with a minor in biology. And I really enjoyed that. I just thrived on that. In the summers, I would come back here and work on our family ranch. When I was a senior, I interviewed for a few different jobs and they just weren't quite what I wanted to do. When I made the choice to come here, even though I suspect there was a part of me that all along, I knew that this was what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be, it just hadn't spoken itself to me. You need to do what makes you happy because money, in and of itself, does not bring happiness. Doing what you enjoy, being with those you love, being with your family, those are the kind of things that bring lasting happiness.","I ended up getting into plant science with a minor in biology.

227,Road Trip Narratives,"I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan and came to the states when I was 13. High school was very interesting. I've struggled in math and science. Contrary to popular opinion, I was not one of those kids that did well in any of that. And I found my langauge was in art. Art was one thing that I stuck to and although I didn't know what I wanted to do, I knew it was going to be some form of art. And I would incorporate it one way or the other. So just having that passion helped drive me to my goal. Do what you love and the rest will come. Believe in yourself and know that there's no such thing as failure because every mistake is an opportunity to learn. Every journey is made along the way because you're meant to go through it. And there's so many things that I've gone through that I've looked at and thought I would not be the person I am today had I not gone through that. Whether it be torrential or not, the triumphs and the failures all mean something along the way.","I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan and came to the states when I was 13. High school was very interesting.

228,Road Trip Narratives,"I thought I wanted to be an intellectual property lawyer because I knew I wanted to do something with technology. But I also had this fear that I was gonna get into a line of work that I was gonna hate. So I really had to take a step back as I was studying to go to law school, and just really determine what I wanted to do with my life. So I just really evaluated really two things. What am I passionate about, and then what are my natural skill sets? What am I good at? And I was realizing , I love a lot of things. I love technology, I love philanthropy. I love sports because I just love working in a team environment, so how can I maybe incorporate those three things? And then when I met my co-founder, who was my roommate at the time, he was basically saying, why don't we disrupt the e-waste industry by getting companies to donate their technology instead of recycling it, and helping others gain access to that technology so we could share our passion. Once we were talking about that, I knew exactly, that's what I needed to be doing. It's really weird, because all of that confusion and fear went away immediately, evaporated. That's kinda how human-I-T came to be. If you're tenacious, determined, and you get people to help you out, there's nothing that you guys can't do, for sure.","I thought I wanted to be an intellectual property lawyer because I knew I wanted to do something with technology. But I also had this fear that I was gonna get into a line of work that I was gonna hate. So I really had to take a step back as I was studying to go to law school, and just really determine what I wanted to do with my life. So I just really evaluated really two things. What am I passionate about, and then what are my natural skill sets? What am I good at? <br><br>And I was realizing , I love a lot of things. I love technology, I love philanthropy. I love sports because I just love working in a team environment, so how can I maybe incorporate those three things? <br><br>And then when I met my co-founder, who was my roommate at the time, he was basically saying, why don't we disrupt the e-waste industry by getting companies to donate their technology instead of recycling it, and helping others gain access to that technology so we could share our passion. <br><br>Once we were talking about that, I knew exactly, that's what I needed to be doing. It's really weird, because all of that confusion and fear went away immediately, evaporated. That's kinda how human-I-T came to be. <br><br>If you're tenacious, determined, and you get people to help you out, there's nothing that you guys can't do, for sure.",,"[0.055886697, 0.10905439,

229,Road Trip Narratives,"Losing my family very young was kind of a life changing experience. I've been working in the film industry for a number of years and so to kind of channel that energy and that angst I was feeling, I wanted to open a school, a cinema and a retail space. Lisa Marr is a teacher and we fell in love. On the opening day she was walking down the street and I said we're opening a film center and she's like, really? And she came in and she started volunteering and we had this platonic relationship that evolved into a romantic relationship. It was the beginning of a whole new chapter in my life. I had just started making films. I had been in a band for many years and did some photography and painting and there was this space right in my own neighborhood that was opening and encouraging people to come in and exchange ideas and watch films together and make their own movies. The education, in the last 10 years we've taught a couple of thousand kids for free. So for the ten year anniversary, we decided let's take everything we do on the road. Again, for us, filmmaking is about storytelling. It's not about the technology, it's not about expensive equipment, it's about an idea and some energy.","Losing my family very young was kind of a life changing experience.

230,Road Trip Narratives,"The two qualities I aspire to are hustle and humility. Hustle for me captures just being totally shameless and persistent and getting someone or something to yes. In the early days that just meant cold calling and cold calling and cold calling reporters until one of them finally did a story about our site and the foundations until one of them finally called me back and made an angel grant to our organization. As for humility, I think as an organization we're humble about the work we do. The very premise of our organization is that teachers on the front lines know their kids better than anybody else in the system. So if we can tap into their front line expertise, we'll unleash better targeted, smarter, more innovative micro solutions than what anybody would come up with from on high. Humility is going to help you be successful as well as make you a nicer person. The hustle is what will get you ahead and the humility is what will have people rooting for you to get ahead.","The two qualities I aspire to are hustle and humility.

231,Road Trip Narratives,"Well, I was always that kid in school that helped the teacher set up connecting to the projector and that kind of stuff. My brother was always tinkering with computers and then tearing them apart and building his own. And I would get his scraps, I would get his old computer. And so it really started with him being a role model and bringing this kinda stuff into my life. And then from there, I just always knew I wanted to be in computers because there's not many people that know a lot about computers. At first when I went into college, I went in as a computer engineer. And I found out very quickly that I did not like it. And then, I switched over to information assurance and have not looked back at all. Confidence is key, definitely. Keep your confidence. You've gotta believe in yourself, gotta keep it together. Sometimes, you fall apart, sometimes that happens. And it's okay because you gotta show people who you are and what you want and stand up for yourself. Get out there, get the experience, do the competitions, go to the conferences, listen to other people's experiences, and by all means, never give up. Don't let anybody tell you that you can't ever.","Well, I was always that kid in school that helped the teacher set up connecting to the projector and that kind of stuff.

232,Road Trip Narratives,"No one thinks about bobsledding as a kid, especially around here, sunny southern California. You see it on TV during the Olympics, and that's it. It's just not something that you think about doing at a young age. When I came to UCLA, even by my fourth, fifth year, I was like, what am I gonna do? Track's almost over, I keep getting hurt throwing javelin, and it's just like, what next? That's when my coach encouraged me to try out for bobsledding. Never been in a sled before, never been on ice before, but you have to realize what can I do now that I'll not be able to do later on? You can't go back and bobsled in ten years , you have to do it now. This is the only time you can do it. So I was like, I gotta go do this, I gotta try it now or else I'll never know. And that ultimately led to Korea for the Winter Olympic Games. So for me, my goal has always been the same, to make the Olympics. I just didn't realize it would be in bobsledding, but here I am.","No one thinks about bobsledding as a kid, especially around here, sunny southern California.

233,Road Trip Narratives,"I grew up loving the water. I think in high school, I started paddling and kayaking, and really started to wanna be in the ocean a lot. And I went to college, and I got really into Hawaiian culture and learning about who I am, where I come from. And through that process I got introduced to the voyaging canoes. Pretty much ever since that first time I got in the canoe I've been totally hooked. And it's like I've never really left the canoe. One of the biggest things that I've learned is the balance. There's a balance out there and life becomes a lot simpler. Humans, we seek that stuff out and it's because it's where we find the better part of ourselves is there. You don't just learn everything in one school, be very open-minded. Really just learn as much as you can and then internalize that and formulate who you're gonna be.","I grew up loving the water.

234,Road Trip Narratives,"I grew up in Nanjing, China. When I was a baby I lost my right leg in a fire. Shortly after that I was abandoned on the street. I was found at a year and a half old and taken to the local government orphanage. Fortunately for me, I was adopted when I was seven years old and came here to the states. When I was 14 years old, I received a running prosthetic. The day that I ran, I remember it being one of the most traumatizing days of my whole life. That was the first time that I was gonna have to be out. I was gonna have to show people that this is who I am, that I couldn't hide, that I was an amputee. I got out there and I started running and I realized I love to do this. This is so liberating. This is so freeing, because I am out and this is who I am. I don't think you ever get one moment, have one experience and you totally accept everything about who you are. That's a life long journey. But the start of that is finding something that allows you to be you.","I grew up in Nanjing, China. When I was a baby I lost my right leg in a fire. Shortly after that I was abandoned on the street.

235,Road Trip Narratives,"I'm the curator of Behavioral Husbandry and Welfare for Oklahoma City Zoo. So I spend a lot of time looking, observing, learning everything we can about the species and about what their needs are to give them many choices in their environment. So that they have varied days and they have a very dynamic environment that they're living in. When I was five years old, I had an encounter with a dolphin. And I was able to look that animal in the eye and that was it for me. I wanted to dedicate my life to working with animals. When I left college, I thought, I'm ready. Put me in a job, I know what to do. And what I found was the animals were the best teachers. They have taught me humility. I think that's a big one. They've taught me compassion, to be a little bit more open and be very understanding. Especially to other human beings. That was something I learned when I left college. I had amazing experiences in college and I loved my classes but I don't think I really started becoming well rounded until I got out of the classroom. And I really started learning the real world stuff. So talk to people, hear their stories, and keep an open mind because every person has something to teach you.","I'm the curator of Behavioral Husbandry and Welfare for Oklahoma City Zoo.

Even though I wanted to write from the time I was little, I was so confused. I looked into being a flight attendant. When I think, that just wasn't something that probably would have been right for me. One great thing to think about in your twenties, as I look back at it, is that things work themselves out.

I'm not saying that doesn't work, but that somewhat you gotta plunge in.","I love my college. But I was in a small town and I knew I wanted to come to New York. But moving to New York City was scary.

Growing up on the Arizona-Mexico border, I was in this kind of homogenous community that was infested with crime, poverty, and drugs. I applied for the Bill Gates scholarship, and I received that scholarship. If I didn't receive that scholarship, I may have not been where I am today. In college, I was majoring in finance and the easiest thing I knew to do was go to work in New York at a finance bank. I realized, wow, the glam of this and the prestige that I was going after is not exactly what I wanted. And then I had a friend who said they were interning at Google. They painted this picture. And I'm like this sounds like Disneyland compared to what I'm doing. So when I came to Google, I felt more comfortable here. And it aligned more to my values. My entire job is trying to increase the number of diverse owned businesses that Google is working with to drive economic impact. So if I can do my part in trying to generate more opportunities, more access to opportunities, then that is my way of thinking about it, making sure that I'm doing right, and not forgetting the voice of people who aren't at the table.","Based off of probability, I shouldn't be where I am today.

238,Road Trip Narratives,"From my time in high school, I knew intimately what it felt like to be left out and not have a voice. And I said, you know what? My life now on is to make people feel included, to make people feel like they had a voice. I am currently the global inclusion program manager for our diverse engagement team, and I am hired to make sure people have a sense of belonging. It's so fun because in this space and this work it's all about behavior change, and that takes some time. But when you see people's behavior changed because of something they didn't know, that they now know, that transformed their life. That's the only thing I need at night, that makes me super happy. So be open to opportunities, and know that your mind may change. What won't change is inherently what's inside you. Or what you feel like you were destined here to do.","From my time in high school, I knew intimately what it felt like to be left out and not have a voice. And I said, you know what?

239,Road Trip Narratives,"I heard about an opportunity in Tanzania to volunteer and work with an organization that was really trying to make an impact with people who are living with HIV. I was offered a position to run the organization that I volunteered at. A really pivotal moment for me was when I came back, I had my first daughter. At six weeks, I brought her back to Africa, and was on the road, and trying to figure how to navigate through childcare. One of my colleagues said it was very irresponsible of me to get pregnant. And that was, to this injustice, fire in me. But I packed up my family from Africa and moved. I guess there was the question of why the US. I just figured the US has childcare figured out. So I just had no idea how broken the system was here, until I started pulling on the thread. And the piece that I really honed in on was, there's a really magical experience with that, the in-home family. It became really clear that if I wanted my kid to experience the change that I was gonna create, I had to start immediately. And so that is the injustice that I'm really trying to correct. I buzz when I'm with people and teams who are trying to solve big problems. Every morning I wake up thinking about the problem and wanna jump out of bed and get started solving it.","I heard about an opportunity in Tanzania to volunteer and work with an organization that was really trying to make an impact with people who are living with HIV.

And that was, to this injustice, fire in me. But I packed up my family from Africa and moved. I guess there was the question of why the US. I just figured the US has childcare figured out. So I just had no idea how broken the system was here, until I started pulling on the thread. <br><br>And the piece that I really honed in on was, there's a really magical experience with that, the in-home family. It became really clear that if I wanted my kid to experience the change that I was gonna create, I had to start immediately. And so that is the injustice that I'm really trying to correct. <br><br>I buzz when I'm with people and teams who are trying to solve big problems. Every morning I wake up thinking about the problem and wanna jump out of bed and get started solving it.",,"[0.0075898734, 0.083265245, -0.010680589, -0.02399864, 0.0050574024, 0.022005968,

241,Road Trip Narratives,"I work at Fossil. I'm an IT solution manager working in the e-commerce division. Typically a day in e-commerce for me, I manage a team that we're currently rolling out global websites for. But I didn't know growing up what is it that I wanted to do. I took a leap of faith, and in 2000 I started a company called BTV Corporation where I was doing consulting work for about eight years. It was a little bit risky, but I think the way to advance, you're going to have to take risk. But you want it to be a calculated risk. You want to make sure that you're making smart decisions and not impulse decisions. So, would my life be different had I not started my own company or even came to Fossil? I'm sure it would be. I don't know what that would be, but I would say, in the end, I am happy with where that journey took me and I appreciate all those that's been around me to support me through that effort.","I work at Fossil.

242,Road Trip Narratives,"I went to the local community college, and just enrolled kind of with no plan. When I first got into it, I thought, political science, that's what I'm doing. But it didn't speak to me as my life calling, so I thought, nutrition. I love human biology and health related topics. Nutrition's where it's at. No. I changed a little there and the classes I enjoyed the most were my art classes. And I got the opportunity to work with computers. It combined my art skills with some skills I had in computers and technologies that I didn't really know I had. Got an opportunity to work here at Mindbody, which also brought in my technical skills and my love for exercise and fitness. So don't let yourself be border complacent for too long. Obviously, there are gonna be times in your life where you have to put your head down and just plough forward, but let that be an ebb and flow.

It combined my art skills with some skills I had in computers and technologies that I didn't really know I had.

243,Road Trip Narratives,"I went to school, because I loved coding and I wanted to develop a coding career. I reached out to a band I liked and said, hey, long shot, but could I make you guys a website? To my surprise, they emailed back ten minutes later. They're like yeah, actually, we'd really love for you to make us a website. How about two t-shirts and a CD in trade for it and I thought that was a great bargain. So I made them a website. I did my first or my second website for two t-shirts and a CD. So technically, not a fair market trade. But at the time, the value proposition for me was way higher. You've gotta choose your shots. You will definitely do things in the course of your career that will be undervalued and the trick is to choose the right ones, and to not do it too much. Throughout your career and in particular in those formative stages, you've got to go the extra mile. You've gotta work really hard. There's just no shortcut to it. Every now and then, one in a million gets lucky and everybody else who's ever achieved some great level of success has worked incredibly hard to get there.","I went to school, because I loved coding and I wanted to develop a coding career.

244,Road Trip Narratives,"In first grade when they asked me what I wanted to do, I said I want to study the stars. So, it's lucky that it worked out. Most of the times people say, I wanna be a football player, whatever, movie star, it doesn't work out. In my case it worked out, but I was lucky that way. Astronomy, before I went to college, was something I really thought I could do. But I just doubt myself a lot. It's inevitable. When you're trying to push yourself, there are always moments when you think, maybe this is too hard, maybe I can not do it. But my answer to that is that, if you don't feel that way, it means you're not pushing yourself enough. If you never go out of your comfort zone, then you're not really trying very hard. It's part of learning and part of growing up, figuring out things that you didn't know you could do, and then you do them. Sometimes you fail. Sometimes you succeed. First of all, in research most of what you do, fails miserably, because you're trying to do something that nobody knows how to do. So you have to really like failure. Embrace failure. Accept that failure is gonna be part of the process.","In first grade when they asked me what I wanted to do, I said I want to study the stars. So, it's lucky that it worked out.

245,Road Trip Narratives,"I started doing theater in high school, and I fell in love with it. Then I got done with high school, and I was like I don't know what else to do. I just enjoy theater, so I'm gonna keep doing theater. I went up to the University of Minnesota Duluth and continued schooling up there. I got a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater with a technical emphasis in lighting and sound. After school, I ended up on tour with South Pacific for a while, and then they ended up needing an audio engineer for the national tour of Blue Man Group. So I ended up moving over to that show once South Pacific closed, and really fell in love with it. And then this position here in Vegas opened up. So I'm the Head of Audio for Blue Man Group in Las Vegas. And that includes supervising a team of other audio professionals and then running the show pretty often. There's rarely a day that I'll leave this building and be like, man, that was a rough day. Usually I leave and I'm really happy. And it's cool that I'm a part of creating something and hopefully inspiring people that come in to our show and putting a smile on somebody's face.","I started doing theater in high school, and I fell in love with it.

246,Road Trip Narratives,"I'm a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School. I teach finance at the business school. And I teach taxation and tax policy at the law school. I've been on the faculty for about 19 years. So the really fun thing about teaching is it's a way to learn things. So when I teach something is when I understand the deeper. And so I just have really come to love it and I think as I've gotten older, I value it even more and more. Teaching has become a bigger and bigger part of my life. I can't say there was like some grand design. There certainly wasn't. I'm not one of those people who saw my future with precision and was simply going down a path with clarity. That's just not the way I was. And in fact when I was doing my PhD was the worst. Because I had gone to business school. People I graduated with from business school are out there in the world making money and I was not. Like I was studying economics. And so that was when I questioned myself the most. And I kind of really thought, what the heck am I doing? Take the time in your 20s to invest in yourself. That can be formal education, that can just be experiences, that can be exposures. You're more likely to under-invest in your experiences than over-invest.","I'm a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School. I teach finance at the business school.

247,Road Trip Narratives,"I head up social innovation for the AT&T foundation. I have the pleasure of running an accelerator program and working with amazing entrepreneurs. The idea is, we take them from good to great. I spent the beginning of my career in public broadcasting, so that for me led naturally to public libraries. A thread through both of those was education. Then these AT&T opportunities sort of came out of nowhere. I had no idea that the sector existed when I was in school. Corporate social responsibility was not a thing 20 years ago, when I was in college and graduate school. If it was, I probably would have thought that sounds really interesting. I'm into that business to impact. That sounds amazing. They say that luck is a combination of opportunity and preparedness, and for me that was definitely the case, in moving into the world I have now. Since I've moved into this world I love it, and I feel honored every day to do it.","I head up social innovation for the AT&T foundation.

It's a risk, for sure. I used to think that the friction was a bad thing. Like, the tension that you feel. You wanna cut the tension. Everything's to ease pain in our society, very much like pain is the enemy. And I don't think that that's true.

So if you feel pulled, that's not a bad thing.","I was thinking, ""Here's what I love, but what I love won't ever make me money, so I'm gonna get an economics degree and just play guitar when I get home I guess.''

249,Road Trip Narratives,"I actually had no idea that tech was a thing. I was in my third year studying chemistry and biology. And I had a friend that graduated, and he taught himself how to code. And we were hanging out, and I was just watching him type away at his computer. And I was like, I used to write code when I was eight years old. And had I known that software was a career that was an obtainable thing for me to do, I would have hands down done it much earlier. But I think also even when I was in school, the idea of computer science classes just seemed really intimidating. From a distance, it looks so complex. But then if you actually learn how to code, it's like, every line is actually very simple. Pretty much I just sunk my teeth in and was like, I gotta just do it until I make it happen. And so from then on, as a professional software engineer, you're building stuff everyday. And they ask me, what do you want to work on? I'm like, I wanna work on something I haven't done before. I don't know how to do it immediately, but I know how to figure it out.","I actually had no idea that tech was a thing. I was in my third year studying chemistry and biology.

250,Road Trip Narratives,"I grew up in Mexico. I thought I was gonna go back and work in Mexico's government and I did, for a while. I started learning about an obscure field called genomics, which is how genes get stitched together and what they do, and I became a professor. One of the weird adventures of the last four years is I got together with a guy who sequenced the human genome and with the guy who won the Nobel for splitting genes. We created a company that thought about programming cells much as you program computer chips. In the measure that we've started to do this, what we're doing is we're beginning to directly and deliberately engineer evolution to do what we want it to do. We want tomatoes to taste this way, we want cows to give this much milk, we want mosquitoes to inject you with vaccines. That is the biggest single change going on out there. It means we're gonna generate entirely new fields of research, entirely new jobs, entirely new industries. There are all these incredible adventures going on. You have probably no idea of where you're gonna end up working in ten years because a lot of the fields you're gonna end up working in don't exist yet.","I grew up in Mexico.

We're gonna do, a special with your play.'' So I agreed. And they shoot a film, Sixteen, and I was with a crew, and I was fascinated. I trained to direct actors, but I never worked in television or any movie before. You have to be honest, about yourself, be honest with others, and be honest about what you want. If you have this spirit of doing what you want to do -- because I think that is the right thing -- you have to do it.

252,Road Trip Narratives,"For 50 years, the Soviet government had created a kind of situation where you weren't allowed to speak back against the government, and if you did, you'd finish up in an insane asylum or you'd never find a really decent job or you'd suffer mightily in some way. I suddenly discovered that you weren't allowed to speak back against a sponsor. And that realization that there was really no democracy on the airwaves gave birth to Adbusters and our website and our campaigns. For me, success meant the admiration of others, being able to increase the circulation of Adbusters Magazine to how big a splash I was making in the world. The last few years of my life, I'm measuring success in terms of how happy I am, how fulfilled I feel. Be open to any opportunities that present itself.","For 50 years, the Soviet government had created a kind of situation where you weren't allowed to speak back against the government, and if you did, you'd finish up in an insane asylum or you'd never find a really decent job or you'd suffer mightily in some way.

254,Road Trip Narratives,"I am now a PhD holder. Two weeks ago, I would still introduce myself as a fifth-year PhD candidate. I have a PhD in chemistry, and I will be walking next weekend. I am actually from Mexico, and I was the first one to graduate from a university in the US with my bachelor's five years ago. Now I will be the first and only one to graduate with a PhD. I did my bachelor's in chemistry. It was kinda natural that I was gonna go and do my PhD in chemistry. Somehow, I knew that that was the right thing to do. I didn't know what I was gonna do with it. I don't know if the job that I get next or in 15 years will have anything to do with my PhD, but I know it's worth it.","I am now a PhD holder.

I did not know and it wasn't until I was in my sophomore year and I was taking that first journalism class they teach and one day Professor Brand said, ""What are you majoring in?'' I said, ""I don't know. PR?'' And he said, ""PR?! The best people are in journalism, you can do this! You could be in journalism.'' In hindsight everything has come together almost eerily logically.

We're an AI technology company that helps studios and publishers make decisions over how they tell their stories and what kind of stories they're acquiring. I decided in fourth grade, when a local television news reporter came and talked to the class, that I wanted to be in news. I pursued journalism in school and did lots of internships, and worked for television stations and newspapers and all sorts. I was really a journalist at heart. My first job out of school was in television news. I produced for ABC News network and Good Morning America, and was there for almost a decade. I took a straight jump from television news into tech, because of course there's a lot in technology that's the same thing. You're telling stories across websites. You're building platforms, and the platforms that I always worked with were content-based. You just keep moving forward and finding what you enjoy and you'll get to something great. The goal isn't to get to something great, but just keep doing things that are great along the way and it's all gonna work out.","I'm the CEO of StoryFit.

I wanted to be a professional musician. I wanted to write a novel. I wanted to paint in all my spare time. I wanted to own a restaurant. I wanted to do all of these things. I had these ideas of what I wanted to do. Fresh ground coffee, some good food, space, music, and all of that. And I walked around asking different owners of different establishments, ""Can I do this? Do I have what it takes?'' I've never even done business before. At the very last moment, I had already even gotten a loan to start my own restaurant. And the very last people I went to were the owners of the Delta of Venus. I asked them, ""I think I want to start a restaurant. Do you have any advice?'' And the two owners looked at each other, and looked at me and said, ""We were just talking about selling the Delta today.'' My whole universe, it was just right. And I just trusted myself that it was right.","I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do. But I knew what I wanted to do. And that was everything. I wanted to be a martial arts expert.

258,Road Trip Narratives,"I wanted to be a reporter, but I found out very quickly that's not something I wanted to do once I actually got my feet wet. I was telling somebody I didn't wanna be a reporter anymore, and they said, why don't you do PR? So I was like yeah, let's do PR. I spent every second working basketball games, field hockey, soccer. There's really no average day. Every day presents problems, new situations. Every media member that you see at a game, production crew, I have to know everyone who's there, but I feel like I've done my job when every group of people I have to deal with felt like I took care of them. I always tell people who want to break into this industry, never limit yourself. If you have to go to Siberia because that's the only sports internship you can get, go to Siberia. People will see your passion, they will see your work, and you'll be able to move up the ladder quicker because of that. Take every experience as a learning experience, and keep moving forward.","I wanted to be a reporter, but I found out very quickly that's not something I wanted to do once I actually got my feet wet.

259,Road Trip Narratives,"My main mission is to monitor the activity of Hawaiian volcanoes and then to assess their threat. But to do that you have to understand a lot about how volcanoes work, which starts with basic geology. I went to University of Southern California and fortunately their curriculum had you go through the four basics of oceanography, biology, chemical, geology, physical. I just happened to take the introduction to geology first and that was it. At that moment I knew I wanted to be a geologist. I began to realize my roots are really here and I was anxious to get back. I never would have known that if I'd stayed. I think you have to be somewhere else to actually see that more clearly. In a way geology helped me with that. It's never gonna be easy. But there's a lot of interesting experiences around here that could help you when you come back. That's the important thing, to take those experiences and bring them back with you. And you'll be a stronger person for all those experiences.","My main mission is to monitor the activity of Hawaiian volcanoes and then to assess their threat.

261,Road Trip Narratives,"I work for Veracity Insurance. We insure a lot of outdoor recreation companies. That can be from the actual operations side, to the people who are manufacturing the equipment for all those. For me it was a job, but then it fell into being a career, because of the love that I have for what I do. And it turned into being a fun passion. We did a lot of stuff in the outdoors with my family. To today, a lot of our activities as a family still evolve around being outside. I enjoy coming to work every single day, I enjoy the people I work with. But when I'm on vacation and I go see some of these areas where I insure these, I get to actually do some of these activities, too. So there's both sides that are a lot of fun.","I work for Veracity Insurance. We insure a lot of outdoor recreation companies.

262,Road Trip Narratives,"I'm a veterinarian in Tennessee. I have two practices here, and then all of a sudden in 1995, a lady came by and wanted to start an elephant sanctuary. And not being able to stay out of trouble, I said sure, I'll help. An elephant sanctuary is a place for retired elephants. Almost all of them have arthritis from performing in circuses. We've got 2700 acres, they can just roam and be free. And that's why it's a sanctuary. A sanctuary is where you're at peace and no one can theoretically disturb you. We want them to be free. I've been helping the sanctuary for 20 years. Watching it grow into the organization it has become, and hopefully, helping it grow. It's been a very satisfying part of my life. I think I'm having success because I'm still having fun at this. At 60, I still love what I do.","I'm a veterinarian in Tennessee.

It's been a very satisfying part of my life. <br><br>I think I'm having success because I'm still having fun at this. At 60, I still love what I do.",,"[0.0690264, 0.12681292, 0.01125188, -0.016010998, 0.0076480806, -0.021911902, -0.0152386045, 0.022370376, 0.0036721863, -0.016935382, 0.010187199, 0.066808514,

263,Road Trip Narratives,"I'm a casting director. I say that I am a writer, producer, actor, sometimes casting director, even though that's my day job. But the thing about the film industry is everything is a game. When I moved back to Atlanta, I was gonna be an actor again. No longer gonna be a casting director , and then I got offered Magic Mike Two at the time as it was known. But when I came to Savannah to rebook local Savannah actors, I couldn't cast a single person. It became so clear at that point that somebody's gotta come in and teach these people exactly what I said in the article. You need classes, you need to learn. And I've spent the better part of a year and a half serving my community, and being of service to other people, and mentoring people, and teaching. But it's now time for me to do my own thing. A lot of things in my life have kind of changed. I felt more confident in my work, I felt more confident in who I was as a person. And I started becoming a little more outspoken about things, which was not appreciated by some people that you work with, but the higher ups appreciated it.","I'm a casting director.

264,Road Trip Narratives,"I never went to a proper film school or worked on traditional film sets and I learned my way up the way that other people might. In the 1980s, Michael Stipe from R.E.M. had a film group that was giving money to underground filmmakers, and he saw some of the stuff that I'd done, and I went down to Athens, Georgia, where his band, R.E.M., was based and there were a lot of other artists and filmmakers. I wasn't specifically trying to do music videos or feature films or documentaries or whatever. Just kind of made these personal, experimental films, and then people that would see those would respond and ask me to go do other things with them or for them. It's an element of putting yourself at the right place at the right time. Like I definitely left the wrong place in New Jersey and went to Athens, Georgia, which, at that time, felt like where I belonged. It's your life and you need to hit all these different experiences while you can.","I never went to a proper film school or worked on traditional film sets and I learned my way up the way that other people might.

265,Road Trip Narratives,"It's hard to become a veterinarian. It's competitive. It's eight years of school, and it's expensive. I had to take on a ton of school loans to be able to get through it. That first year of undergrad, it just seemed like I don't know what I wanna do, but this just seems so uphill and I'm looking at a lot of debt if I go through with this. Even in the best case scenario, I'm gonna take on loans and scholarships. You pause all the time and you kinda revisit it. What are the things that really make me happy? And ultimately, it was that I want to work with animals. Maybe someday I'm gonna work with an animal that could be going extinct, or is gonna be endangered. Or I'm gonna be working in a place where, if we're not doing something, things are gonna change, and the world's not gonna be as good. And I think what I learned about choosing to come to work here is that, you're going to be the happiest at the place that kind of best aligns with who you think you are and what you really want to be. And I found that drive towards animals was the most aligned with my heart than anywhere else I had worked or wanted to work.","It's hard to become a veterinarian. It's competitive.

266,Road Trip Narratives,"I remember being 18, trying to figure out what degree to study. And I still remember it, on the lower right-hand side of the Detroit Free Press, on the front page, they listed the highest starting salaries. Chemical engineer was at the top. So I said, I guess I'll do that. I decided to find a job using my degree. When I got to apply the skills I learned at school, I actually enjoyed it. I realized that I like this, and I figured out how to apply my skills. I went back to graduate school, and then ended up getting a job in Grand Rapids, Michigan for one of Herman Miller Suppliers. 13 years later, I'm still here. And it's amazing to be part of an organization that tries to live up to its values every day. We don't always succeed. But by and large, every day I come in, and my team's job is to ask the question, have I made the best choice possible and look for innovative ways to make the world a better place? I think that's so important, finding a company where you feel comfortable and they share this common set of values. If you land in a good company, the opportunities will open up. I've never been focused on the next promotion. It's all about getting immersed in my work and doing the best job that I can. And generally, good things have worked out from there.","I remember being 18, trying to figure out what degree to study.

267,Road Trip Narratives,"I run a collective woodshop. We are home to about eight furniture makers who make their living making furniture in the shop here. And we also teach woodworking classes. Most people think I make my living making furniture, but most of my time is spent managing the woodshop. My whole family has this ethic of working with their hands and being able to do things for themselves. And that's something that I grew up with and I saw, and it's not something that I had in my jobs. I was finding myself in jobs where I was behind computers, I was on the phone. I thought the work was very important, but at the end of the day, I wasn't very happy with how my time was spent during the day. And so I eventually took a year off, moved up to Northern California. Went to the Krenov School. It's a year-long certificate program on furniture making. That's kind of how I got into woodworking. It's something that keeps me feeling like I'm connected to my family and my roots. So be introspective, and do some soul-searching and think about what your strengths are, what it is that you love to do, and figure out if there's a way to turn that into your career path.","I run a collective woodshop.

268,Road Trip Narratives,"I am the executive chef for Bacchanal here at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I grew up in Mexico. And my family, it's all about food. I realized that food was my passion when I was about eight years old. I love being in there with the food. I studied for two years, but cooking is something that you develop the skill throughout the years. And you keep getting better and better at it. And it just becomes a part of who you are. As a female, it's a little bit of a challenge because you're entering into a world that is more male oriented. And so you have to be able to keep up with them. But life prepares you for everything a step at a time. 32 years has prepared me to deal with 124 cooks and thousands and thousands of guests. People say it's so much, it's so stressful, but it really comes easy for me now.","I am the executive chef for Bacchanal here at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I grew up in Mexico.

I had actually taken the MCATs, which are the entrance to medical school, so I was really going in that direction. In my senior year, I decided that was not for me. The reason I came to Sandia and to New Mexico is to work on an inorganic sponge-like material that cleans up radioactive cesium. It's very exciting to think of a way of solving a big problem. When you can see that side of any kind of profession, it's incredibly fulfilling. To be successful you really have to love what you're doing. You can put up with the little stuff that always will get in the way.

And so this whole focus was on creating capability. But when you're in the entrepreneurship world and the commercial world, that's a different mindset. When I worked for the government. I could spend the government money on my ideas. But I'm out here as an entrepreneur, I have to spend my own money. So that was hard for me, to try to get that switch going on. My approach, and what I always tell people is you have to start connecting, networking. And a lot of people thinks that's hard , but it is not really hard. It's just a matter of meeting people, and let them know what you do or what you wanna do.","When I got out of college, I went into the Army Reserve, through the Communications Officer.

272,Road Trip Narratives,"As a singer-songwriter I wrote about a lot of stuff that other people didn't write about. I wrote songs like ""They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore''. But when I look back on it, I think I was mostly a truthteller. My goal was to tell the truth. Let the chips fall where they may. As an author, the same thing. Running for governor is just an extension of that. A lot of people go to college with the idea they're gonna learn all this, talk to people and get all this wisdom. But they already know they're gonna be a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills or they know they're gonna take over their dad's business. Some people, like me, wander through the whole thing. We don't know what we're gonna do. It's just learning from life itself -- that's the best classroom.","As a singer-songwriter I wrote about a lot of stuff that other people didn't write about.

275,Road Trip Narratives,"I thought I was gonna be a professional dancer. I'd come home at 10 PM and I would be really tired physically and mentally, and I just kind of decided, I don't wanna do that any more. I transitioned into creative writing and, probably one of the best decisions I ever made in my life, because ultimately that led me here. This was the second job I applied to, out of 43 jobs. I get to make sure that the products that come to me are in a very specific format, that I can make sure it gets all of the approvals from all of the people they need to get approvals from. Ultimately I still use my dance skills. One of the main things we learned about was improvisation. I use that all the time. I got to be the most nit-picky grammar nerd ever. They let me talk about hyphens and dashes like nobody's business. When it comes down to like, you have to take this path or whatever to be an engineer or an architect or a scientist or a writer or literary agent or an actor or anything like that, I don't see a lot of people who do that.","I thought I was gonna be a professional dancer.

It's actually not really something that drives me. In school, I realized that what made me really happy and passionate and motivated me was working in teams to solve problems. That kind of was really nebulous for me at the time of how you turn that into a career, until I found consulting. It didn't force me to choose one career, it allowed me to continue exploring, and trying different things. I did not think I was ever going to be an entrepreneur. I left consulting to go to school, get my Masters. Commit started while I was still in school. I graduated less than two months ago, and have been working on my startup full time since then. I'm 28 now and I still haven't answered for myself, what do I wanna be when I grow up?

277,Road Trip Narratives,"We were driving in the car. And my father was just making conversation and said, ""So, what do you want?"" ""To study?'' I said, ""Um, well, you know, I think I want to study philosophy.'' And my mother was a philosopher. So he pulled the car over, looked back at me, and said, ""When you finish your medical residency, you can do anything you want.'' You know, I think all immigrant families understand this to an extent, that your parents want you to do something safe. Have a skill that no one can take away from you, no matter what. So I ended up being able to do that which I most wanted to do anyway , but I went through it, through the sciences. Following your dreams is one thing, but you're going to be much better at following your dreams if you have some sort of skill. And that paying your dues and getting some sort of rigorous training so that you actually know how to do something is very much worthwhile.","We were driving in the car.

278,Road Trip Narratives,"I wanted to be an artist when I was in high school, but I actually started in nursing school. We were really poor, and my dad died when I was six, and I saw my mom struggle working in a sewing factory. I thought, well this is crazy to be a starving artist. I better do something practical. So I went to school for nursing. Photography and me was a better fit. So, I started at the Miami Herald as a staff photographer, just from there moved on to do international stories, so I bounced around a lot. I traveled a whole lot. When you can capture a moment, capture history, preserve that second of time, that's meaningful in some way. If it makes you feel, it's probably gonna make someone else feel too. But those were the moments that I always look for. I feel like there's all different types of photography that you have to appreciate. You can do all these stylized beautiful perfectly composed pictures, but for me, journalism, I think the only thing that matters is the content in the moment and making someone feel. Because you can make someone think, but to make someone feel is the ultimate goal. The more you can do to connect people, the less hatred there will be in the world, the more understanding there will be.","I wanted to be an artist when I was in high school, but I actually started in nursing school.

279,Road Trip Narratives,"Despite having a low income background, my mom fought to make sure I had a high income education. So I went to some good schools, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Northwestern University for law school, and it hasn't been easy. Even as an undergrad, I had to pay my way through after not having the capability to do my financial aid stuff right and doing poorly and my brother passing away when I was in college. And the jokes that grown kids were making jokes and I was waiting tables, working a lot of jobs. Folks calling me all sorts of names and saying, aren't you gonna wait on me today? Are you sure you're not working today? You need to be waiting on me. One of the things I was grateful for is I always had a glimpse of what life was going to be like for my family and I, and it wasn't gonna be a one-way struggle my whole life. As long as I stay focused and paid attention to the right things, I would be all right. Now it's painful, of course, being made fun of by classmates for wearing hand me down clothes and stuff from Goodwill and all that. Studying by candlelight, because you didn't have the lights. You have to know deep down that whatever's going on in your life is not gonna be your story, that's just gonna be a chapter.","Despite having a low income background, my mom fought to make sure I had a high income education. So I went to some good schools, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Northwestern University for law school, and it hasn't been easy. Even as an undergrad, I had to pay my way through after not having the capability to do my financial aid stuff right and doing poorly and my brother passing away when I was in college. <br><br>And the jokes that grown kids were making jokes and I was waiting tables, working a lot of jobs. Folks calling me all sorts of names and saying, aren't you gonna wait on me today? Are you sure you're not working today? You need to be waiting on me. <br><br>One of the things I was grateful for is I always had a glimpse of what life was going to be like for my family and I, and it wasn't gonna be a one-way struggle my whole life.

280,Road Trip Narratives,"I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas, born and raised. Little Rock in the 90s was on the top five crime lists and murder rate lists in the country. It was a bad time for that city. I never felt like I belonged there. I just felt like this isn't right. I decided to change my life. And I didn't really know all the ways how yet, but I knew not being in Little Rock needed to be a part of it. Little Rock is too small , but I was nervous that I might not be ready to go to New York, or LA. So a mid size city. Looking for a low crime rate, and trend in technology upward. And Seattle was that place. I do think that one of the most powerful things in the world is understanding what you want, and just trying to figure out how to focus on that. Just today, not forever, not in ten years, because you'll be different in five years. You just are how you are now. And knowing what you want right now is the thing that should drive what you're doing. I've been able to do that, and I've been very successful and it's not because I'm special. It's just because I focused on what I wanted.","I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas, born and raised. Little Rock in the 90s was on the top five crime lists and murder rate lists in the country.

So when you see yourself, what you did when you were little -- what you really enjoyed doing -- just go back to that age. The point is really enjoying what you do. And it's not so much about money -- of course money counts -- but when you enjoy what you like to do, you work so hard that eventually the money is gonna come because hard work is paid.","I grew up in Honduras.

282,Road Trip Narratives,"I always knew I wanted to do journalism since I was a little kid. I was writing for my school paper in fifth grade. But by the time I graduated, I still didn't know if I wanted to do newspaper, or if I wanted to do TV and I ended up doing TV. And I just really enjoy talking to people. I feel like that was why I wanted to do journalism, because everyone's so different, everybody has different stories, and people are just interesting. I love watching TV, I like watching TV, but I never really thought about the possibilities of working in TV. It's just been such an amazing experience. It's a hard job, but it's really rewarding. I think it's a dream job that I didn't realize I had. I don't always know if I'm making the right decision while I'm making them. I feel sometimes, am I stunting myself in my career? Am I where I'm supposed to be right now? Am I doing all that I can to get to the next point? But you don't always know if you're doing the right thing, but it works out. I feel like things just work themselves out. ","I always knew I wanted to do journalism since I was a little kid. I was writing for my school paper in fifth grade.

283,Road Trip Narratives,"I grew up in New York City. My mom was a schoolteacher in Harlem in the South Bronx. When I was 15, I graduated early from high school and spent a year working with my mom in Harlem as a school teacher, as a paraprofessional school teacher. We weren't from a really wealthy family or anything, but we had educational privilege. As a teacher you see the rewards of working with individual kids and you see the inequality and unfairness all the time. So, I was really aware of the fundamental injustice in our society but I felt a responsibility to do something with all the privilege that I had.","I grew up in New York City.

284,Road Trip Narratives,"My uncle was a civil engineer and a land surveyor. I started working with him to make money in the summertime. Then I realized I kinda wanted to do engineering, but I first went to college at Saint Peter's College in Jersey City, and they didn't offer engineering at that school. My cousin started at ODU the year before. We visited some friends of mine, and we liked the area. I figured, if I wanna do engineering , I wanna go here and check this school out. I read up on it. It was a good school. And that's how I ended up in that program. You got four years, or five years, or six years, no matter how long you're in school. You kinda panic about what am I gonna do next? Really, you can do anything next. People are learning more about their jobs and their careers by working their jobs and careers. You can really go anywhere and start working, as long as you are smart and you wanna work.","My uncle was a civil engineer and a land surveyor.

286,Road Trip Narratives,"One of the things my parents always taught me was to always take pride in your work, regardless if it's cleaning toilets. Even though I was working just at the mall, I still took a lot of pride in work and being a holiday cashier. Eventually they kept me on, it ended up being something I fell in love with. 27 years later, I'm still here. When I left my hometown I was 21. I was moving to Los Angeles, I had just finished college. My aunt was talking very negatively about my decision, you're gonna fail, you're gonna come back crawling, anything you can imagine that would be demotivating. I didn't talk back to her, but I internalized a lot of her negativity and processed it more as empowerment. It's interesting because many years later the whole family knows what I do for a living now and even she has said I am so proud of you. And I said to her, you're part of the reason that I made it, because your non-belief in me actually pushed me just as hard as the people that did believe in me. So don't ever let anyone that doesn't believe in you affect your strength, just channel that energy in a very positive way.","One of the things my parents always taught me was to always take pride in your work, regardless if it's cleaning toilets.

287,Road Trip Narratives,"So I'm a program manager and I work in the Criminal Justice Reform Department and we're working to safely reform the criminal justice system, reduce incarceration while keeping our neighborhood safe, and it's an exciting role. I really love what I do. I love meeting the people who've been impacted by our criminal justice system. I'm also system-impacted. I ultimately spent 12 years in state corrections and it was definitely the toughest part of my life. I came out and I owned what got me incarcerated. Really was able to dive down deep in myself and really think how did I get there. It's given me a perspective that other programs managers that are working in criminal justice reform don't have. We think of people as disposable and we've gotta shift the narrative around that. We don't want people leaving our jails and prisons and not having opportunities to thrive and contribute. I think there's a lot of work to be done here. And it's a really crazy turn of events of where I've ended up in life, but I feel like I'm where I should be.","So I'm a program manager and I work in the Criminal Justice Reform Department and we're working to safely reform the criminal justice system, reduce incarceration while keeping our neighborhood safe, and it's an exciting role.

Obviously, that decision has paid off in the sense that Kaplan has provided all kinds of opportunities for me. But it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been willing to say, I'm gonna step off of one track, take a step back and build a new trajectory. That decision really was the crucial one in my career. I felt that I wanted a different path and it's been great because that's what I wanted. And when you do what you wanna do, what you're passionate about, you're gonna be more successful. So you wanna listen to people, you wanna hear their advice, but you gotta be willing to make your own decision about your own life. If you pursue the things that matter most to you, you're gonna maximize your chances of being successful.","I started off thinking I wanted to be a lawyer.

289,Road Trip Narratives,"Bret and I were always interested in breaking things. We would go to pay phones and cut the wire, then go back later and clip it back and get all the change that it saved up and do stuff like that. I think that's probably what really motivated me to go into how can I make this a career? I switched my major five times. After that I got into some physical security and did some physical stuff for a while. And then got into federal and state and local and then convinced them to let me do some testing. And that's where all the professional hacker stuff started coming into play. And with that experience it opened up doorways to other things. So eventually I got on at Solutionary and went and got Bret on and we're still doing the same thing we did when we were 13 years old, but doing it without the risk of getting arrested. I said it was always a hobby, but it was also my dream job, but at the time I wasn't really sure how to make that switch, because I didn't necessarily go to college specifically for that. I didn't get a degree in computer science. I actually got a degree in graphic design. And once I got to a certain level, a friend let me know that where he worked at Solutionary was hiring and it just kind of went from there. So one day I was a web and graphic designer and project manager and then the next day I was a security consultant.","Bret and I were always interested in breaking things.

290,Road Trip Narratives,"Originally, I wanted to go into the FBI. But my roommate in college, his parents owned a sushi bar, so he grew up cutting fish and working around the restaurant. He would have all these amazing meals, and I would be eating either spaghetti with a jar of tomato sauce and a can of tuna or something. It was pretty gross compared to my roommate making his elaborate French sauces and roasting a chicken. And I said, nah, I need to be eating like that, not what I'm eating. So I enrolled in some cooking classes, not with the intention of becoming a chef. I thought this was gonna be six weeks of my life and I'm back into my FBI career, but that six weeks turned into 22 years in restaurants now. That's how I started. I wasn't a child cooking prodigy, I didn't grow up in a restaurant of chefs or washing dishes at my mom's restaurant. It was just me independently finding that passion for food and cooking and hospitality.","Originally, I wanted to go into the FBI.

291,Road Trip Narratives,"I just completed an associates degree at Hawaii Community College last year. It took me ten years because I did it part time. And that was way after I finished my PhD in biology. The tendency is to make it look like there is a golden path, and it's your job to find it. That's not true. I found my true identity incrementally. With all of my Japanese knowledge, I had left a chunk of me behind in my journey. So I had this big task of having to integrate myself so that I can function as one whole person. You have to go through a bit of a soul searching thing. That's why doing something like Hawaiian studies aligns you a little bit, recognizing who you are, where you come from.","I just completed an associates degree at Hawaii Community College last year.

292,Road Trip Narratives,"I'm a biology lecturer and special projects coordinator. As I was a child I was an outpatient at Shiners Hospital because I thought I had a curvature in my spine. That was my first interaction as an outpatient with a physical therapist. From there all the way to high school the goal in the head was that was definitely what I was gonna be. I decided to go to college and in my junior year going into my senior year, I took a human genetic course for non science majors. And I was in heaven. I also got involved with the research and I figured why not give it a try? So I decided to do research, still doing both. In the end I had to pick one and research was the one I decided to pick. We're all young when we start our journeys out. For some of us it's delayed and then we finally come to it after working. But it's always gonna be changing depending on what you experience. You just gotta go with whatever the wind blows your way, because you might miss an opportunity. If I just said research, forget it, then I would have missed where I am today,","I'm a biology lecturer and special projects coordinator.

293,Road Trip Narratives,"Growing up with just my dad and my brother, I was obviously very independent and strong-willed. My dad's best friend was a stockbroker, and for some reason, because I was so good with money, I decided that I would be a really good stockbroker. And fortunately, throughout high school, we had work exchange and work experience, and they used to send me off with all sorts of random checks and things to deliver somewhere, and I had no idea where I was going or how to get there. And being the little surfy chick that I was, it just made me realize that wasn't the avenue I wanted to go down. Ultimately, to become successful in anything, you have to be relatively selfish. You have to be so one-dimensional. I also believe that there's no such thing as a mistake, it's only a learning experience. The only mistake is not learning from it. But even then, you're just gonna be given the opportunity to learn it and learn it and learn it until such time as you do. So I made the same ""mistake'' over and over again until I actually got the lesson.","Growing up with just my dad and my brother, I was obviously very independent and strong-willed.

295,Road Trip Narratives,"I was born and raised in Hong Kong. After I graduated from high school, I moved to California for college and I went to UC Davis. My parents advised me, you have three choices with your career, you can either be a doctor, or a lawyer, or an engineer. And thank God I chose engineer, because I fell in love with it. I didn't think about going to an insurance industry. I had specific companies in mind that I wanted to work for related to chemical engineering. But then, when I stumbled upon FM Global, I was immediately hooked that I get to work with different risk managers and different facilities. So I thought that was the best opportunity that I could give myself to open my horizon a little bit. So what I am doing now is heading up the cyber unit here in FM Global to make sure that we have the adequate engineering products and services so that we can offer our clients the best risk management solutions for cyber. So we have been burning things up in a lab. We do explosions, we do shake tables for an earthquake, we fill rooms with water to test our flood barriers. But it's really time now to come up with a tool to help our clients to mitigate cyber risk as well. So I'm really excited to be part of that innovation team just to start up something new.","I was born and raised in Hong Kong.

296,Road Trip Narratives,"I went to culinary school when I was 16 year old. In the beginning I wasn't really planning to be a chef. I wanted to travel to different countries. I didn't speak all the languages in the countries I wanted to go. This meant I had to find something to do that can make money in the countries I was planning to go to. Once I found my path, once I decided that was my path, my family and friends kinda pulled me back, to try and take me off that path. It's important to stay on that path and kind of ignore all that. If you do not follow your path it's tough to be successful. You have to follow your path whatever it is. It's very important to listen to people too. But, whatever you think of it, you have to follow your own path.","I went to culinary school when I was 16 year old. In the beginning I wasn't really planning to be a chef.

297,Road Trip Narratives,"I had these two worlds where I was in science and then I was also interested in just science fiction. I couldn't quite reconcile the two, I still almost get a little strange feeling in my stomach like knots. Those couple years after college I felt stalled. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. And I don't want to go back and relive those two years. But I got through it. I do think it's important to have clear goals in mind. You can always change your goal. You don't have to suffer if something isn't working out and quitting something once in a while is okay. Because there may be something around the corner that's waiting for you and you'll miss it otherwise. And have faith that you will be able to express yourself successfully within those goals.","I had these two worlds where I was in science and then I was also interested in just science fiction.

300,Road Trip Narratives,"I've had multiple experiences, and all of them have been very significant in my evolution. I originally majored in geology because I liked rocks. Then they threw physics at me, and I decided that this was not for me. But I clearly didn't know what I was doing. I jumped from job to job trying to figure out. Seven months at a time, trying to figure out what I wanted to do. It took years later when I discovered community education, and I really felt the passion. I don't think the search ever ends. And I don't think one ever finds oneself. It's a constant journey. It's a constant search. I see more and more the pressure of making decisions about life. That somehow, if you don't decide where you go and how to get there, there's failure up ahead. I think that when I allowed myself the enjoyment of the journey and was not fearful that it would leave me to a dead end, it was fun.","I've had multiple experiences, and all of them have been very significant in my evolution.

301,Road Trip Narratives,"I grew up in Nigeria. But we came from a very entrepreneurial family. And that meant that people were doers. And I believe in life, that you actually have the capacity to do whatever it is you want to do. Nobody else is going to do it. There are so many things you see in life that you feel like there's injustice. But often times you just relax and say somebody else is gonna do it. Well that somebody else is you. Computer scientists know nothing ever works the first time, that's the beauty of it. It's a problem solving thing, and so failure is built into the act of learning. You have to like trip and trip, and trip, and trip. And then, once you figure out all the ways you can trip, you finally learn how to walk. It's little baby steps to build that muscle of courage and confidence. Just take a deep breath, and just tell your feet to move, and your feet will move.","I grew up in Nigeria.

302,Road Trip Narratives,"I am the chief medical information officer for Yuma Regional. I have a number of areas of focus. One is really how our electronic health records work. So, if you go and you're seen in our emergency department or you're seen in one of our clinics, like a lot of health systems, we have a way for patients to log in and see their own health information. I help lead up the group of people that should look at how we can make that MyCare experience better because there's almost no such thing as perfect health. As we solve some of the basic problems of medicine, there's other frontiers. And it's like, how do we take our technology and solve those really difficult problems? I tell people sometimes that I feel like I have the best job in the world. And I didn't know what I wanted to do in life. I kept just doing different things. I could say that I am at my ultimate goal.","I am the chief medical information officer for Yuma Regional. I have a number of areas of focus. One is really how our electronic health records work.

And it's like, how do we take our technology and solve those really difficult problems? <br><br>I tell people sometimes that I feel like I have the best job in the world. And I didn't know what I wanted to do in life. I kept just doing different things. I could say that I am at my ultimate goal.",,"[0.07252635, 0.044085823, -0.006678714, -0.02329188, -0.015649315, 0.00067078264, -0.030680683, -0.019644758, -0.0072458507, 0.016318778, 0.056053076,

303,Road Trip Narratives,"I always grew up with tea being a staple at our dining table. One of my colleagues from my previous job knew a recruiter at eBay and he recommended me and they ended up hiring me. One day I was trying to make loose-leaf tea at my desk, and by the time I would make it, I would be late for a meeting. Every time I tried to use tea bags instead, I was never satisfied with the quality because it was not as flavorful, it didn't have as much aroma. That was my first point of inspiration to think about the idea for tea drops. It took me about a year and a half of experimenting. I would spend my weekends and my week nights blending and I was obsessed with figuring it out. Once I had that, I started sharing it with my colleagues and friends and family. Now we're available in over 1,600 retail stores. My logic was, even if this failed, even if nothing ever comes of it, I know I would have gained so much in trying.","I always grew up with tea being a staple at our dining table.

Because my wife, myself, we come from a generation where we were told Indians are good with their hands, they're not meant for college. So just get a high school education and go to work. What drove me truly was, I wanted to help my people and I went to Community College, transferred to Black Hills State College, graduated from there in 1985. And immediately after law school, I came home to the reservation and there were no jobs in the Legal Profession. But the college had a directors position in institutional development and they hired me. And lo and behold they hired me as the acting president in 1991. So that's become the passion now is to help our children and our grandchildren succeed and to again, instill with them a higher passion than just a job from eight to five.","My wife and I call ourselves, laughingly, fixers, so it's our job to go in and help institutions and organizations that are flailing or floundering.

305,Road Trip Narratives,"I had a psychedelic painted bus. And it was a wonderful experience for me. And I got to be a doctor for a bunch of rock and roll bands. So I was able to be with this group, with Ken Kesey and all the crazies of the 1960s, and make a movie, and wound up at the end of the movie in India. So it was a different kind of a life than I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, expecting. And I became passionately obsessed with eradicating small pox. That's all I thought about for five years, was eradicating smallpox. And we eradicated smallpox. It doesn't exist anymore. The disease does not exist anywhere in the world. My experience is that you have to be open a little bit to what might come uniquely for you, but you have to come to that moment with a mental and the spiritual and the physical and the scholarly preparation so that you have something to offer.","I had a psychedelic painted bus.

So it was a different kind of a life than I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, expecting. <br><br>And I became passionately obsessed with eradicating small pox. That's all I thought about for five years, was eradicating smallpox. And we eradicated smallpox. It doesn't exist anymore. The disease does not exist anywhere in the world. <br><br>My experience is that you have to be open a little bit to what might come uniquely for you, but you have to come to that moment with a mental and the spiritual and the physical and the scholarly preparation so that you have something to offer.",,"[0.04529452, 0.093892746, 0.010964295, -0.037679277, 0.050075166, -0.055197086, -0.068530366,

306,Road Trip Narratives,"I grew up with a mom as an artist. She was a landscape photographer, so every summer for about one month we would travel somewhere fairly remote. We started just going to different places in the United States, and when I was 10 or 11, we started leaving the country every year. That gave me this time and space for a month at least every year to soak up nature. I traveled to Greenland in 2006 for the first time with my family, and at the time, climate change was really not a topic of discussion here in the United States, as it is today. I just didn't realize how huge of a crisis it was, and it made me realize I wanted to focus my work on those issues. Climate change is such a distant concept for most of us, because it's not happening in our everyday lives. It's like this slow train wreck and it disengages us. You get scared, and shocked, and overwhelmed, and then you don't know what to do. A lot of studies have shown that we make decisions, and we take actions based on our emotions more than anything else. You can write the word glacier and you can describe it. If you see an image of a glacier it's an experience. I'm trying to encourage people with positivity and hope. If you fall in love with something, you wanna protect it. You wanna do what's the best for it.","I grew up with a mom as an artist. She was a landscape photographer, so every summer for about one month we would travel somewhere fairly remote.

307,Road Trip Narratives,"In college, I was figuring my life out. I didn't have an exact plan in terms of what I wanted to do. Everybody that acted in the capacity of a guidance counselor to me helped mold me into where I am today. For instance, when I was in high school, my guidance counselor told me, Chris, based on what I know about you, I know you love to be in big cities. I know you love to study human behavior and psychology. We discussed where I might end up in college, so I chose to go to NYU based on that feedback. And when I got my first job in marketing analytics, it's when I realized that hey, this is really cool, I actually really like this. Don't feel like you have to know all the answers right now. The more strict you are in terms of what you think you want to do, the less options you'll have. So think outside the box and keep an open mind.","In college, I was figuring my life out.

Crying and ironing, thinking, ""Who did I think I was that I could do this?'' Crying, ironing, crying. I finally went home at 4 o'clock to be open again at 9am in the morning. That day, I had lines outside my shop. I did the turnover I hoped I'd do in a week. I did it in that day. In a week, I did the turnover I hoped I'd do in a month. And it never stopped. It went on from there. As you achieve success, along will come people who want to spoil it. And that is difficult.

Things just happen. I didn't know what graphic design was as a discipline until much later, probably halfway through college. I think I wasted a lot of time expecting there to be some sort of white light moment where, oh the sky is parted and now I'm inspired and I'm gonna work for two weeks straight and get this thing done. It's so easy to be like, well I'm not inspired today, I'll go do something else. But you have got to put the work in. You've still got to structure yourself. I spent so much of my 20s being like, when is the magic gonna strike or something like that. Time is short, and there's gonna be no magic moment where you're like, now is the time to do it. Like that's just not gonna happen. No one's gonna come to the rescue and say all right, that dream you have, we're gonna start now. I spent a lot of time waiting for that to happen, it doesn't happen.","If you told me, yeah I'm gonna move to New Orleans, and take over an abandoned iron factory, and start a design studio and travel around and write about cities, who plans for that?

313,Road Trip Narratives,"I went to UC Berkeley and I started out as a philosophy major and an art major. And then I took anthropology. And then I thought, I wanna do theater. And then after I got out, I was like I'm just going to try to get a real job but I wanted to be in a place that felt right and I applied to the Asian art museum. I applied for the program assistant position in performing arts, and I have museum experience, I have my anthro background, I have theater. It just kind of came together, and it was totally unplanned. The thing is, I never knew a job like what I have now existed or could exist. I just sort of positioned myself with things that really felt right. It's really a matter of instinct on some level and a broad plotting of things. I've felt just pretty open about how the future will pan out. Your path is what you make of it. There are positions out there, there are careers out there that you can fit into. But there also things that you can make yourself and you have to just trust that you have something unique to offer and to be consistent with that in your choices.","I went to UC Berkeley and I started out as a philosophy major and an art major.
